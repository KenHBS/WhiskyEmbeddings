1792 Ridgemont Reserve,"Color: Medium to light amber from core to edge. The tears are thick and grasping, but turn spotty after a few minutes of trailing.","Nose: There’s an immediate rush of the classic aromas, like toffee, butterscotch, and citrus; however, the more I nosed this, mint, grass, and tobacco leaf slowly began seeping out. Not punchy and weighty, but not simple, either. The longer it sat, the aromas became more specific: Peppermint, orange peel, grapefruit juice, pipe tobacco, tupelo honey. There is a slight artificial plastic note, just swimming around discreetly, though. ","Mouthfeel: Velvety but not too weighty. Not thin, but a medium-light feel. Slightly parching and grasping at the cheeks through the chew. Creamy after a minute or so chewing.","Palate: Cool citrus and cucumber notes on the front of the tongue quickly turn to spice and sourdough bread, while sweet butter seems to infiltrate the rest of the palate. The rye is very noticeable high in the gums and cheeks, presenting not as spice and nuts (like in other high-rye bourbons) but more as a peppermint candy. The taste is fairly simple, though, and there isn’t a ton of flavor-morphing through the chew.","Finish: Butterscotch and peppermint really strive on after the swallow, with a nice dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, and even a bit of tobacco leaf in the back of the throat. But there’s more of a finish of texture than of flavor, as the creamed butter just continues to coat the palate. Really enjoyable, even if a little short.","Overall: The nose on this is nice and complex, especially the longer it sat; unfortunately, the palate just didn’t live up to the nose-hype (new favorite term!) and the finish was a bit short. The honey and butter flavor, as well as the buttery finish, really made this dram for me, but points taken off for the plastic undertone on the nose. I can’t wait until there’s a cask-strength offering of this. The straight from the barrel taste I had at the distillery forced me to look at this bourbon with new eyes, and I am a fan.

1792 Ridgemont Reserve,Edit: Forgot the proof - this one is 93.7 proof.,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2fy7v2/review_26_1792_ridgemont_reserve/
1792 Ridgemont Reserve,"Appearance: Burnished/chestnut? Pretty nice, glass-coating legs. The bottle, for what it’s worth, is friggin’ gorgeous.","Nose: I’ve heard rumblings that 1792 is unique for having a fairly high barley content in its mashbill. I’m not sure how that would figure in the finished project, but there’s certainly something fairly unique here. Creamy custard, light banana. Vanilla, obviously. Light oranges. There’s a real pleasant almost graininess to it? Some chocolate. Fairly assertive rye spiciness, a very outdoorsy, rural sort of rye/grain/agricultural quality. Dry wood. Light hints of baking spice. A bit of brown sugar. Over time, the freshness of the vanilla really jumps out, as does the orange and banana. Light maple syrup, and a heavenly caramel character after about 25 minutes. But I’m really digging that creamy custard note. ","Taste: Oily initial, and yet still a certain sense of weaker body than you’d expect at 46+%. Fairly hot on the mouth. That creamy custard/vanilla note comes through, but there’s a bit of sourness here that’s not quite ideal (though it thankfully fades). Pretty muscular rye spice. Citrus. Chocolate or hazelnut. Dry wood. Not overly sweet. Fairly dry, in fact. Something vaguely Scotch-y in the mid-to-back of the mouth that’s hard to articulate (like a light Speyside or Highland), perhaps a kind of barley sugar quality?","Finish: Medium. Some dryness. Wood. Citrus (again, orange). There’s that custard still. A bit of off sourness.","Thoughts: Pretty unique. Time helps this one (the bottle has really grown on me), and the nose is really, really great, but the rest of the package doesn’t quite follow through (still good, though, don’t get me wrong). But damn, that custard! Also strikes me as a bourbon that would be great in cocktails.",Score: 84,"Appearance: Ever-so-slightly lighter than the 1792, perhaps burnished. Good legs, though a bit less body than the 1792. The bottle/branding on this one is also very nice, though I think the 1792 wins for aesthetics.","Nose: Banana is the big one here (either over- or under-ripe). Seems thin, somehow, which is a weird thing to observe on the nose. Something sort of herbal/vegetal. Sort of a musty quality? Faint diacetyl (buttered popcorn). Significant green apple. Oak, but light. A bit of sharp alcohol vapour. A mineral, granite or flint-like sort of quality. Hazelnuts. Cocoa powder. Grapes (or grappa, I guess?). Distant BBQ pork, or at least some BBQ sauce? Maple syrup. A bit of butterscotch or toffee.","Taste: Green apples, cooked with cinnamon. Light body and mouthfeel, a decent bit of heat. Dry wood and barrel char. Brown sugar. Maple syrup. Fairly simple, enjoyable—not overly sweet, but not overly spicy or bitter, either.","Finish: Medium. Fairly dry. Lingering heat. Woody tannins, some green apple for a good long chunk of time. Yeasty, like someone snuck in a bit of Beam (something herbal, or vegetal)?","Thoughts: Another one that would probably do well in cocktails. Not my favourite, but certainly not a bad whiskey, and worth trying for the way it seems to get away from some of the stereotypical ‘bourbon’ notes. At the price they’re asking, though . . .",Score: 82,"Verdict: They’re not really all that alike in character (aside from both being fairly unusual interpretations of ‘bourbon’), but 1792 Ridgemont Reserve wins this one hands down. Neither whiskey is perfect, and my feeling is that both are quite overpriced for what they are (especially up here in Canada, and especially the Woodford), but the Ridgemont is more unique, more muscular (in terms of flavour, body, and ABV), and its nose (especially as it opens) is just hands-down great, whatever other shortcomings it may have.",http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1l1070/a_headtohead_review_s_19_20_woodford_reserve_vs/

Simple notes but it does them well. Really smooth. The taste leaves a little to be desired, but if you like a dry bourbon this might be for you. The rye spice is not very pervasive, but there is just enough to let you know its there. It will certainly numb the back end of the palate.

1792 Small Batch,"Appearance: Deep copper? Burnished. Surprisingly dark. Decent legs. And though I went back and forth on it at first, I actually dig the rebranding, aesthetics-wise. I like the gold/red combo, and am totally okay with dropping that weird fabric thing around the neck of the old bottle. (Also, ignore the photo because I did taste this from a glencairn. I just like that particular rocks glass)","Nose: This is the 1792 I remember. Custard and bananas. Lots of custard and bananas. Some cinnamon and baking spice, quite a bit more singe on the nostrils than I’d expect from a premium offering. Mint, vanilla. Rye bread. Raw sugar? Barrel char. Faintly medicinal or herbal. Licorice? Light toffee. Slight mango? Almost malty and scotch-like (I’ve heard Barton uses more barley than most US distilleries in its mashbill)? Very similar to what I recall of its precursor. ","Taste: Again, similar to my recollections. Hotter than I expected, and thinner, too. Quite hot. Light cherry liqueur at first. Bitter citrus pith (grapefruit). A pretty dry bourbon, aside from an initial hit of sweetness right at the beginning of the sip. Custard, a touch of banana. Toasted wood, vanilla, a bit of butterscotch. Dry maple syrup, if that makes sense? Maybe maple tree sap? Baking spices playing around in the background. Peppery throughout. Orange. Herbal, medicinal. A bit of caraway and clove? That really rich, intense custard I remember from the earlier version (one of that version’s selling points) seems to me really muted here, which is disappointing.","Finish: Dry. Wood char, barrel flavour. Yeasty? Herbal. Menthol. Slightly sour. Not a great finish. Very . . . rustic?","Thoughts: I didn’t go back to my notes for the earlier version until I completed my tasting of the new bottling. Looking at them now, it seems there are a lot of similarities (as there should be, since it’s essentially the same juice, minus an age statement). But—and this is as likely to be my palate developing as a substantive change in the whiskey—there are some aspects here that I’m not super happy about: the finish isn’t great, the taste is way hotter and more alcohol-forward than it should be at this ABV, and I’m not crazy about the front-to-back dryness of this spirit (aside from the initial hit of sweetness on the tongue, there’s a lot of dryness, a lot of bitterness).

1792 Small Batch,"Nose: Very standard bourbon nose - typical caramel and vanilla sweets, moderate about of woody oak with just a little tannic complexity. It doesn't smell as young as I expected and the heat is well tamed.","Taste: Yep, tastes like bourbon. No surprises here as it's mostly a rehash of the nose. On the sweet side I find a little extra honey in the mix now and the finish has a little rye spice tingle. Again my biggest surprise is it doesn't taste as young as I expected. Unlike the Bottle in Bond product which must be the product of distillate from the same season, I suspect this small batch is a mix of some older and younger barrels which I think has created a nice balance of younger grain forward fruity notes along with older more tannic complex wood notes.","Thoughts: This is about as standard of a bourbon as you can get. It's not too woody, not too young, not too sweet, and not very bitter. It's just an all around safe bourbon whiskey. That might be its biggest downfall though as that also makes it somewhat boring. If you are just looking for a good daily sipper this would fit that bill very nicely and I feel it's just a notch above some of the other products near this price range like Wild Turkey 101 and Old Forester Signature though not as good as something like Henry McKenna or Eagle Rare.

That's becoming a regular thing, now that I recognize it.  Alcohol.  Very prevalent, even as this sits approximately two feet below on my desk.  The usual suspects of oak and vanilla round things out.  Oh, wait, some caramel snuck up on me.","Palate:  It's light.  I think the proof is showing, here.  I like my whiskey to be high in proof, and this feels thin and lacking.  Definitely get some vanilla, oak, and caramel, but they're faint.  Sweetness is there, but it's fleeting.  Nothing else, really.","Finish:  Lacking.  It's weird, all I seem to get is an alcohol burn from this, and it's pitiful at this proof.  Astringent, but not bad by itself.

A.D. Laws Four Grain Straight Bourbon,"Noses: Leather and tobacco in both, for sure. The leather is much stronger in the Laws. Laws really just has a much more potent nose altogether. Tastes: The Scotch has more fruit in it, along with peat (obviously). The smoke and leather are still stronger in the Laws, but there’s a similarity between the two. Finishes: This reminds me of why I’m not a fan of (this) Scotch. The finish is just foul. It’s smoky, like the Laws, but the peat and something else just don’t jive with me.","Larceny: The only other wheater I like right now. Let’s look at how much more complex the four grain is. Noses: Larceny almost doesn’t have a nose compared to Laws. It has more vanilla, and more young oak. Tastes: Larceny, while good, is just a lot more boring. I like it still, but it’s just lacking. There’s no tobacco or char present, and the baked goods in the Larceny is still in the Laws. Larceny is also much thinner in the mouth. Finishes: Similar once the leather fades from the Laws.","Noses: There’s a shared char that’s stronger in the Laws. FR gives more of the traditional caramel and vanilla. FR is about as rich as Laws, but much more subdued.  Tastes: More sweet notes in the FR, but overall very similar at the core. Finishes: These two finishes are the most similar.

Aberfeldy 12,Price: $53 CAD,Colour: Honey,"Nose: There is a lot going on here, immediately I'm getting ripened fruits, mainly pair but also hints of apple and possibly raspberries. I smell again about 5 minutes after sitting in the glass and I now notice even more going on. To try to paint the picture I would say it would be like a walk through an orchard, lots of ripened fresh fruit goodness with subtle smokiness in the background. A very pleasant nosing experience! ","Taste: Such a great mouthfeel, easily one of the best whiskies I own. My first thoughts are of sweetness, lots of butterscotch but not to the point of it being overly sweet. The tasting notes at the store said it was a balance between smokey and sweet and I can kind of see where they were going with that. Although the smoke is subtle, it is there and it compliments the butterscotch and oakiness very well. Definitely less going on than in the nose but I would still consider this to have a fairly complex and satisfying flavour profile. ","Finish: A lot smokier on the finish, but its a sweet smoke. Almost like sweet barbequed ribs. This isnt a laid back finish, its in your face and noisy, but not at all in a bad way. It lasts awhile on the palate and the smokieness fades away to caramel and oak.","Conclusion: I find this to be a decently complex Whisky at a low price tag. I paid less for this than I did for Macallan Gold or Glenlivet 12 and I enjoy every aspect of it more than either of those two. The more I go back to nosing this Whisky the more I enjoy it, it has almost a perfect nosing experience in my opinion. The taste was slightly dissapointing after experiencing the nose but it certainly isn't bad, it just leaves a little more to be desired. However the finish certainly makes up for it and leaves a wonderful sweet bbq taste on the palate for quite a while.

Dry finish, with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and… fig?","Overall:  I don’t think I’ve tried an Arran release in the last year that I’ve disliked.  This is another example of a non-aged release from the distillery that might show its youth in some respects, but still presents it very well.

I didn’t get enough time with it at the tasting to really fairly judge.  It seems to have similar elements to what I so enjoy about Johnnie Walker Green, just in a more subdued way.

Fresh citrus peel with vanilla, remaining honeyed barley notes, a touch of spice and barest hint of peat.","Overall: There’s nothing wrong at all with this whisky, but by the time we’re 4 whiskies into the tasting, it just doesn’t hold up to some of the preceding malts.  I don’t know if it’s the lower ABV, or just that the whisky is more delicate by its nature, but it feels neutered.

","Overall: My relationship with is historically hit or miss.  Many of their official bottlings are just not for me, but some of their Tempest releases have been possibly my favorite scotches tried to date.  Given my history with them, I expected to have a strong reaction one way or the other when tasting the Small Batch, but… no.  I feel similarly to the Jura… It’s a nice, fairly well balanced, entry-point to Islay whisky.  Like the Jura, my initial impression is that it hits similar notes to Johnnie Walker Green, but just not as well (for me, anyway).  That said, it’s a very pleasant and well constructed non-age statement whisky at a very reasonable price-point (as is the Jura).  So to both whiskies, kudos for that.

I feel like there’s smoke hiding in there somewhere, but it never fully emerges.","Overall: Anything Springbank makes always turns out to be an interesting beast.  There’s some really weird and funky notes in there that I can only assume are the result of the dunnage warehouses, but they work for me.  I would dearly love to try a cask strength Springbank/Longrow release, because as much as I enjoy this dram, it feels slightly watered down.  I do think it benefits from a few drops of water to help suppress a bit of the harshness of the vegetal peat notes, but it also seems to drown surprisingly easily.

","Nose:  Honey, Vanilla, Caramel, sweet tobacco","Palate: I taste what I smelled. Also, brown sugar that’s been slightly caramelized. A mixture of white & milk chocolate.  Slight alcohol burn, not bad at all. Just enough to let you know it’s there.",Finish: Brief yet smooth. Lasts about 20 seconds.

Aberfeldy 12,"Nose: Different fruity notes, including apple tart and liqueur.  Pastry or scone dough, honey, some salt, and several hints of straw.  Not the most exciting or complex nose, but still perfectly pleasant.","Body: A bit thin and could coat the mouth better, but adequate.  Isn’t memorable at all, and the 40% ABV works against it here, I think.  There’s some substance to it, to be sure, but not enough.","Palate: Lots of apple tart and honey from the nose, some brown sugar, and just a bit of spices and orange peel or coriander as well.  A decent (if again, not complex) balance of sweet and fruity.","Finish: Surprisingly smoother than I remember.  It doesn’t really linger, but it also doesn’t burn either.  Still entirely nondescript, though.  My memory of that remains firmly intact and validated.","Price: USD $40 at a nearby Total Wine.  Definitely overpriced, this is a $30 bottle of scotch, not a $40 bottle, but it’s not so overpriced as to be criminal, which I guess keeps with its priority of being inoffensive.","Overall: Still tastes like a more boring Dewar’s.  Still tastes boring in general.  But it could be a lot worse, and the Aberfeldy 12 does have some genuine smoothness and balance working in its favor.  Its problem is that it’s a daily session drink, but it isn’t priced like a daily session drink.  I can get its qualities from Speyburn 10 or the aforementioned Dewar’s for much less, and I would, too.  77/100",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3p8cwf/review_17_aberfeldy_12/

There is a very slight cooling effect on the nose which reminds me of honeyed menthol. Lots and lots of vanilla and caramel. This is quite a nose actually. It evolves after a while and is pleasant all the way through.,"Taste: Just as much sweetness on the palate as there is on the nose. Ripe oranges, vanilla, and toffee. For a 21yo, there is only a very slight bitterness to be found, the oranges now turn to blood oranges. ",Finish: Medium-long. Very sweet and warming with milk chocolate and oak tannins.,"Conclusion: As part of the Dewars blend, Aberfeldy is known for their smooth single malts. From what I hear, the 21yo OB is magnificent. However, at only 2/3rd of the price, while a little edgier, this one is a bargain -- and still comparable when it comes to character. I highly recommend trying it after having had a rich dinner. I found this dram to go extremely well with all kinds of meat, fish, and heavy spices. It’s not an offensive whisky, yet very enjoyable to drink. I mainly picked it up to diversify my sherry bomb and aced drams, to have something more balanced.",http://de.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1oo532/review_17_aberfeldy_1991_gordon_macphail/

Good whisky music too. ",Nose: cereal. Bog. Sour grape. Thick soy. Wet hay. Soft cereal. Brine. White pepper. ,Palate: very cereal and malt led. Boggy peat. Green apple. Brine. Some smoke. Sour grape. Wet hay. Vanilla. Some cream cheese at the end.,Finish: burnt. Sore. Woody malt. Bitter.,"Comments: Just rough. Quite astonishingly bad. I am surprised this is sold as widely as it is, as this is not at all the sort of drink that I would give to someone starting out. One to avoid. However, I will try to find some IB Jura, to see if this is bad juice entirely,  or just a poor attempt at mass produced whisky. ",Nose: Sherried oak. Golden syrup. A little white pepper heat. Cloves. Star anise. Orange peel. Vanilla. ,Palate: watery. Sherry forward. Pungent. Bitter tannins and wood. Some raisins and cinnamon. Slight wood smoke. Walnuts and figs.,Finish: Spice and smoke. Short. ,"Comments: This is a good whisky. It’s very drinkable, but the finish is short, and whilst the taste is pleasant, the notes are somewhat fleeting. It would benefit immeasurably for being NCF and a higher strength. For this reason I will definitely be seeking out the 12 year old NCF! ","Nose: Very green. Strong pear, apple and underripe grape. Malt. Caramel. Heather. Very very slight charcoal. ",Palate: Very watery. Surprising oak here. Some creamy citrus. Fake apple. Chemical sweetener. Some smoked malt towards the end.,Finish: more sweetener. Bitter apple.,"Comments: This is not great whisky, but it’s alright. It’s quite weird for an entry malt to be honest, and feels like it hasn’t had enough time. That said I had some of this before I got into whisky seriously and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so perhaps (without sounding too elitist) I’ve just got used to the “good stuff”.

Aberlour 10,"Appearance: Chestnut, perhaps?  Has the look of a sherry cask all over it. Rather viscous, but with a few legs still showing up when I swirl. ","Nose: This one blooms out of the glass and climbs up your nostrils. Dominant smell is tied in with the sherry here—quite vinous and grape-y, but also hints of fresh fruit. Strawberries at first, though they fade. Cherries. Pears. Fruitcake at Christmas (holiday spices, generally). Raisins for sure. Faint leather? Even fainter grass? Sweetness. A couple drops of water lead to a kind of caramel/butterscotch note, perhaps? Some nuttiness after fifteen-twenty minutes.","Taste: Somewhat acidic and a bit fiery at the 10 year and 43% ABV mark (though smoother than I actually expected). Big on the sherry. Vinous but somewhat indistinct otherwise. Again, leather. Peppery. Faintly raisin-y. Not a lot of the nice fruitiness on the nose comes through on the palate, which is a disappointment. Tomatoes? Grass? Water tames some of the youth, but jumbles the flavours even more (just a lot of red wine)—it’s probably better that this stuff is bottled at 43%, all things considered.","Finish:  Short-to-medium length, and again somewhat indistinct. Winey. Raisins and some holiday spices. Faint citrus zest (orange peel?). Faint figs and apricots.","Thoughts: I’m not typically big on the heavily sherry-ed single malts (I tend to prefer the big Islay flavours or big traditional oak), so take my assessment with a grain of salt, but Aberlour 10 Year Old is a respectable-but-unspectacular whisky. Especially for the age and the price range (as I’ve mentioned—at $38 Cdn., this stuff is competing more with low-to-mid-range blends than single malts), the nose delivers in big ways—but the taste ultimately falls a bit flat for me.  If you’re new to scotch and on a tight budget, I’d probably recommend this—but less on its own merits than as a counterpoint to some of the other entry-level malts. Aberlour 10 lacks the smoothness and softness of the two inexpensive ‘Glens’, but it’s a nice low-cost glimpse into some of the interesting flavours that can be at work in a whisky (and provides an avenue for examination of how finishing can affect a whisky, and give you a chance to see whether you’re into the sherry influence). I doubt I’d buy another bottle, but I’d personally love to compare this to an Aberlour that didn’t spend time in sherry casks.",Score: 81/100,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/10b0bx/review_3_aberlour_10_year_old/

Feels a bit like the Dolphins in the first half, disappointed, confused. There were aspects of both casks but not in any harmony but wildly muddled.

A nice combination between the honey sweetness and the peppery touch I found and lived in the 12 NCF. This really makes me want to try the A'bunadh.

Tasting this blind in not knowing it was only 40% ABV, it felt reasonably well-bodied.","Palate: A continued blending of the cakey notes and the fruit from the nose, but the cake has transformed into pastry or pie crust along with some salt and black pepper that I didn’t expect, and I’m not really sure if it fits or not.

Very light and delicate, though the malt continues to dominate over the other flavors. The slight vanilla increases through the middle coupled with a bit of oak and honey.

The nose pretty well sets you up for everything to come with little surprises throughout. It's a very straightforward whisky, and is nicely balanced and delicate. The malt seems very overpowering, as the oak barrels have not imparted as much flavor as the regular Aberlour Sherry Casks, so the oak and vanilla you would expect tend to remain a bit too far in the background for my taste.

Unlike DC, the malt notes aren’t dominant here, and that makes for a more interesting experience. With a little air, the NCF is still quite drinkable, which is somewhat surprising.

Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured,"Nose: Sherried notes hit first, and hard (Don’t even have my nose in the glencairn)! Deep fruits, almost a tangy orange note. The fruits settle down into raspberries and citrus. A floral note comes out after some time in the glass.",Palate: Nice solid mouthfeel. Slightly oily. Oak notes behind fruity sweetness. Spices develop faintly. Herbs and strawberries develop near the end.,Finish: Medium-Long. The strawberry stays from the palate. Orange notes fade in and out. A menthol note appears near the end and sums up the finish quite nicely. ,"Conclusion: A well-balanced malt, as it seems both cask types suit the spirit well. However, the notes on the palate seem faint compared to the powerful nose on this one. A great beginning dram, but it has some untapped potential. I’m extremely interested in the 12 year, NCF offering, as it might unleash some of this potential.",Score: 84/100,"Nose: Sherry notes, red currants, red grapes, dates. Berry medley, with distinct strawberry and raspberry notes providing a sweet/sour balance. Candied sugars. Very slight hint of oak. I love this nose. Let’s see if the palate and finish live up to it.","Palate: Creamy malt. Sherried candies, almost like a blend between strawberries and toffee. Sun-dried raisins. Citrus notes come out. The mouthfeel is jammy, heavy, and thick. The high proof provides a nice tingle, quite like the menthol in the 12 year double cask.",Finish: A long lasting finish. Cherries come out and blend together with a nice citrus note of lemons and oranges. Sugared rock candies top off the finish with a sublime sweetness.,"Conclusion: A beautiful malt. Hands down one of my favorite malts. The palate tastes a little young with that creamy malt note, but this whisky is crafted around that sweetness. Everything seems sculpted to have a proper place. If something seems too sweet, a tad bit of sourness brings it back into equilibrium. The finish and the palate truly live up to the nose and leave me wanting to come back to this dram and discover if I’ve missed anything (I have!).

Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured,"Atmosphere: Mid afternoon on a crisp, sunny Sunday. Good day for walks and coffee, and we had plenty of both in the morning and early afternoon. I had picked up a bottle of the Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban for the upcoming community review, and we decided to have a bit of fun.",Visuals: Golden wheat. Impressively dense coloring. The whisky maintains its golden hue even when tilting the glass and looking through the thinest slices. The whisky coats the glass before dissolving into thin legs.,"Nose: Neat: Caramel. Toffee. Apple. There’s also a delicate bit of oak here. Watered: A bit more delicate than neat, and brighter as well. Vanilla comes through with the water, and we both also swore we smelled citrus at one point or another, but could never quite place it.","Taste: Neat: Caramel. Toffee. Light, but not delicate. Fruity, not the apple from the nose. You can definitely taste the oak if you hold it against your tongue. Watered: Substantially more delicate. More wood. Les caramel.",Finish: It starts with caramel but is quickly overpowered by wood. Mulled fruits. Bits of pepper. There’s also an earthiness here that’s hard to place.,"Overall: 88. This is simple and not particularly complex. However, it is also incredibly smooth, and the flavors present ring through quite clearly and with power.

Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured,Cask: The Duel ,Color: Pale yellow like Chardonnay.,"Nose: Straightforward malt dominates. At 11 years old, the oak has only touched the whisky with a bit of vanilla and sweetness. A bit of spiced gingerbread. Very light floral notes with fresh apples are just beginning to become present. A touch of cherry at the end.","Taste: Very light oil mouth-feel. It takes some work to coat your mouth and get a good taste. Very light and delicate, though the malt continues to dominate over the other flavors. The slight vanilla increases through the middle coupled with a bit of oak and honey. Fresh red fruits continue to play in the background and, if I did not know to look for them due to it being Aberlour, I probably would not have noticed them.","Finish: Warm spice. Very agreeable finish, although it is markedly shorter than your average Aberlour 12. The malt, once again takes front seat, but the oakiness really shines. The vanilla is in the backdrop and the fruits are almost nonexistent, but faintly there if you're looking for them.","Overall: Due to the lack of extra-aging in Sherry casks, this dram leaves much to be desired. The nose pretty well sets you up for everything to come with little surprises throughout. It's a very straightforward whisky, and is nicely balanced and delicate. The malt seems very overpowering, as the oak barrels have not imparted as much flavor as the regular Aberlour Sherry Casks, so the oak and vanilla you would expect tend to remain a bit too far in the background for my taste. Overall, this is a nice drinking dram, but the price tag leaves you expecting much more.",Price: $60,Taste: 69/75,Value: 11/15,Uniqueness: 3/5,Total: 84/100,Color: Golden amber.,Nose: Slight Malt. Honey and ripe red fruits (red apple and cherry jump out at me). Subtle dark chocolate leads to vanilla and oak in the backdrop with a touch of spiced wine. ,"Taste: Oily mouth-feel, much heavier than the DT, but still medium to light bodied. More ripe fruits. The apple really stands out in the taste. More vanilla and oak with a bit of honey. The malt is still present, but the other characters shine through much more boldly as it sit in the background nicely. Just a touch of bittersweet chocolate before giving way to spiced wine.","Finish: Much longer than the DT and much warmer. Not offensively spiced, but the spice really takes front stage. The fruits taste a bit heavier and less fresh and ripe, much like apple and cherry preserves. Almost a dryness on the very end.","Overall: This whisky is a much more rounded out dram by comparison. It develops nicely throughout the drinking experience and is fairly straightforward, but has more subtle nuances throughout than the plain DT. I, personally, really enjoy the Sherry Cask Speysides, so this is right up my alley, though I much prefer the Abunad’h, if I could afford it.",Price: $50,Taste: 70/75,Value: 13/15,Uniqueness: 3/5,Total: 89/100,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/s99i9/duncan_taylor_nc2_aberlour_11_year_vs_aberlour_12/c4c4j18

I think I would say that the flavours here are a bit diluted, but still good and there is a bit of darkness.","Finish: dried cherries, lemon zest, some dusty oak and jack daniel’s honey to finish it off.","Conclusion: Reviews on this sub speak so highly of the A’bundah that I wanted to try something from Aberlour.  This is a pretty solid dram for the price at the LCBO.  I would lean a bit more towards the Glenfarclas 12, but that’s personal preference.  Someone once mentioned I should try the Aberlour 12 NCF.

Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured,"Nose: tart grapes accompanied by honey sweetness, baking spices, brown sugar, oak, a faint hint of your favorite marker paint – It's like the Sherry casks come first and then the Bourbon casks have their entry.

","Design:  I don’t love the colour scheme, but it’s designed to make it stand out on a back bar or shelf, what with the powder blue label.  ","Conclusion:  It’s a decent beginner’s malt or simple dram to enjoy on ice in the summer. Not really my bag, but not bad. I prefer the 12-year-old. The brand rep mentioned that some of the flavours in this indicate that it must be 7.5 years of age on average, but… yeah.

Excellent winter dram if you’re not craving smokiness or peat influence.  ,Price:  $150  ,Tasted:  At a Pernod Ricard/Chivas Bros. tasting alongside several other entries in their portfolio.,Colour:  Amber +2  ,"Nose:  Oloroso sherry influence makes itself immediately known—nuttiness, syrupiness, oak-derived smokiness, warming spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and walnuts.

I feel like I’m being overly harsh on packaging today.  ,"Conclusion:  Lovely malt and a wonderful intro to ex-sherry/European oak cask influence. Oddly chocolatey. Reminds me of Chivas Regal, but minus the … blendy bits. I do like it.  (This is actually the second time I’ve had this whisky, each of which were at tastings or events.

","Finish:  Sweet caramel, smoke, chocolate, spices, oak fibres, fresh ream of printer paper, sawdust.  ",Design:  I like the labels from batch 20-30 more.  ,"Conclusion:  Wonderful stuff, plenty of cask influence, though I get more red wine than sherry.

Fits their house style well, but different enough to stand out from the rest of their lineup. Pomace notes are lovely, and somehow work with the plastic-y/bucket-y flavours.

Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured,"Nose: Figs, strawberries, and marmalade all burst out at first, undoubtedly because of Aberlour’s sherry sherryness, but beneath are surprising notes of cream and vanilla extract.  High tea, anyone?","Body: A tad thin, and much thinner than the 12 NCF, but still with a reasonable enough heft and weight that it isn’t out of character as an Aberlour.  Perhaps a slight negative, but not an overly detrimental one.","Palate: Plenty of fruit, especially grapes and cherries, are present, but in a fruit tart sort of taste, since there are hints of spice flavors as well, like nutmeg, cinnamon, or even gingersnap.","Finish: The creaminess from the nose makes an encore appearance, along with some leafier botanical notes as the finish tapers out into a medium linger.  Not terribly complex, but enjoyable just the same.","Price: USD $37 at my local liquor store.  Worth every penny if you’re in the market for an entry-level sherrybomb, or you want a daily drinker with more character than the big supermarket brands.","Overall: This isn’t a bad whisky by any means, but it’s sort of the Laphroaig 10 of sherried whiskies, by which I mean it’s a young expression that hits you hard with its main flavor.  But unlike similar products from larger distilleries, Aberlour 12 at least tries to offer a trifle of depth, whereas its competitors are largely one-trick ponies.  For this, it gets a more favorable final tally than it otherwise would have.  83/100","Nose: Grapes, dates, and figs leap out first from the sherry—this is Aberlour, after all—and some grain or wheat beneath it, like you’re munching on toast with jam for breakfast, except way better.","Body: A lot of depth and texture, which, on top of the lack of chill filtration, the higher ABV compared to the standard 12 probably helps with.  Syrupy, but not too overly so—simply full and rounded in feel.  Very enjoyable.","Palate: The jam and sherry from the nose continues, but are joined by flavors of molasses, maple, blackberries, strawberries, and plums.  It’s not enough to simply call it “fruity;” I could detect a lot of different individual fruit flavors, and they interacted together quite pleasantly and with seemingly little effort.  I’m reviewing this in September, but really, it’d be soooooo on point during the winter.","Finish: Smooth with a slight burn, decidedly above average for a 12 year old scotch.  Lingers a decent length and tapers out into a final burst of jammy sweetness at the very end, which was a rather satisfying note to end the dram on.  Let this be a lesson: chill filtration makes scotch worse.","Price: USD $55 in my neighborhood and roughly the same online, which I think is an entirely reasonable price point for the quality and depth of what you’re getting.  The standard 12 is, like I said, in the $35-40 neighborhood and represents a decent bang-for-buck buy in its own right, but really, these are two different whiskies and are priced accordingly.","Overall: This is, like the Old Pulteney 12, one of the best exhibits of evidence that age isn’t the be-all, end-all with scotch, and that you can still get an excellent whisky without shelling out for the increasingly pricey 15-21 year old expressions.  The layers of depth in the palate and the smoothness of the finish speak to the quality that electing to not chill filter can impart, and makes it a decidedly superior product to the standard 12.  Definitely not a scotch for those of you who don’t care for the sherry-crazed potions that Aberlour concocts, but otherwise, definitely worth a go.  89/100",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3l1n7n/reviews_7_8_aberlour_12_and_aberlour_12_ncf/

Fruits and spices abound. Fresh red apples, a big waft of medicinal edge, crushed red pepper, cinnamon, roses in full bloom, Dubble Bubble bubble gum, an acidic walk through an orange grove (Floridian here . . .).

Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured,"Nose: Sweet dried fruits on the nose, figs, raisins and sultanas.  Mild clove with unripe cherries.   To me it seems there are decent sherry casks at work here. From the standard oak casks I only get a hint of pear and cooked apples.  A pleasant nose, but not fantastic.","Taste: The sherry casks all but disappear, and the oak casks take front stage.  Ever so slightly "" spirity "", even though it is bottled at a relatively low 43% ABV.  A mishmash of both cask characteristics; very slight notes of the usual sherry cask raisin and chocolate flavors, and more dominate notes of vanilla and honey.  No particular flavor steals the show, and not many others stand out as well.  Somewhat disappointing.  Only barley and oak seem to make any lasting appearance.","Finish: The finish is a tad dry and barley infused and rather uneventful.

Very sweet and sour, that is accompanied by an almost floral element.","Taste: This is super smooth throughout, almost to an extent where it’s hard to analyze at times. A sweetness at first that leads into subtle sour green apples. The apples give way about half way through the “taste”, which turns to charcoal notes and a light oaky spice. ","Finish: Both sour and sweet elements carry over, hanging onto a bit of the charcoal note as well. The floral notes in the nose come back here at the end of the taste, but I can’t put my finger on any particular flower names….it is just floral. A decent yet light mouth feel. The flavor lingers for 1-2 minutes.",Rating: 84/100,"Summary: I’ve had my ups and downs with this Scotch. Overall it’s a pretty low key and is trying to be as inoffensive as possible. It’s very simple, its major elements are sweet, and it doesn’t really leave a characteristically defining impact on me.

Out of everything I currently have, this is where I would start someone new to Scotch tasting.",Content: 40%,"Region: Speyside, Scotland","Nose: Overall a light nose, with white grapes and green apples being the primary elements. Certainly some charcoal influence coming at the end. It rings of sweetness.","Taste: Really smooth and light from the start, the green apples certainly take the forefront with only hint of sweet grapes at the edge of the flavor. The fruitiness gives way to a nice and bit heavier charcoal element that leaves as quickly as it arrived. ","Finish: Aftertaste is rich but un-abrasive, with vanilla, mild spiced cinnamon (certainly of sherry origin) and a background of oak. It is a pronounced aftertaste, but lingers for only about 1-2 minutes. Very little mouth feel, but there is some. ",Rating: 88/100,"Summary: This is nice, if a bit simple. I wouldn’t actually call it simple, the small elements of bourbon and sherry influence save it from that fate, but it’s not very complex, however in Macallan fashion it embraces the flavor profile it does have in stride. This has its place when you want something low key yet has some character going on in the background. ",Content: 43%,"Region: Speyside, Scotland","Nose: Grapes and apples to about equal degrees, with maybe a touch of cherry. A spiciness that wraps itself nicely into the initial fruit aroma, with a lingering oak background. It’s nice, not too overwhelming but certainly appetizing. ","Taste: Starts right out holding none of its cards back, with a nice “sizzling” spice that is accompanied by sweet apples, grapes and cinnamon. Honestly it could have more complex/evolving flavors in it, but the flavor profile it does present, it embraces with solid and complementary notes. ","Finish: The spice and cinnamon hang around in force while the fruit flavors fade off giving rise to the previously understated oak notes.

The sherry spice is deep and prevalent much more so then the 12, and stings the nostrils (in a good way). Similar to the spice being upped, so is the oak that is much more available in the overall aroma. ","Taste: Delightful sherry note that is deep and lasting with a strong spice that rings on the tongue with a notable oak flavor that rides the edge of the spice. This “evolves” into its flavors with much more grace then the 12, and the grapes, apples, and cherry notes come in towards the second half of the flavor.","Finish: The spice, oak, and fruits are pronounced but do not replace one another as the flavor evolves over time, everything mingles together into a delightful complete taste. The mouth feel is much more prevalent and hot on the tongue, and without a decent enough amount of time could very quickly numb it. The flavor lingers for easily 3-4 minutes plus.",Rating: 95/100,"Summary: This is really spectacular and exactly what I was expecting out of a “high end” Scotch.

It doesn’t take long for the most intense part to pass, where afterwards come in caramel, a myriad of different apples but mainly red, sweet grapes, a bit of cherry, a tinge of bitter on the tongue.

All very upfront and in your face.","Finish: Hot spice lingers on the tongue, with a nice oak note coming through now.

A bit of numbing of the tongue which I love.",Rating: 95/100,"Summary: Wow, this is superb! I don’t think it’s as evolving in taste as the 18, but all of its flavors are much more powerful and rich. I really enjoy Macallan for their focus on hot spice notes, and boy does this have it in force. I hunted down the last two bottles I could find locally, and I’m glad I did.

Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured,Distillery: Aberlour,Age: 12 Years,Source: 750mL bottle $47 USD,"Summary: Being my first Sherried Scotch purchase, the first dram was really something for an Islay and Bourbon drinker. I never really liked wine in the past, so the first smell to me was just rancid grapes and just ""that wine smell"" that I didn't like. I pretty much just held my breath as I drank it and thought it was tasty stuff, but smelled bad. I eventually grew to like the Sherry smell and I now I fully embrace it! As for the dram itself... A decent dram but it certainly tasted quite watered down and light with its 40% ABV and all that. I was not too thrilled about how the fruity and Sherry notes didn't stick around strongly enough. I thought the whole point of the double cask maturing was to have the Sherry be more integrated and less superficial. Very unfortunate because I can taste a very nicely flavored whisky in there, it just needed a slight push to give it some extra ""oomph"" to be great. Maybe I've been drinking too much Bourbon lately and got spoiled by the high strength and bolder flavor profile? But certainly even when compared to the rest of its family, particularly the 12 NCF for a more fair comparison, it just pales in comparison and felt inferior in every way possible. I was both happy and sad when I finally got to try the 12 NCF. I was glad that Aberlour really came through with a 12 year old expression that was amazing, but also sad that my bottle of regular ol' 12 was lacking compared to the 12 NCF. The 12 NCF, being pretty much the same exact thing except just higher strength and NCF, really did deliver on what I expected from the double cask matured Sherry monster that is the Aberlour style. Overall I really think it's a decent whisky for the money that just needs a little something. Definitely try to get the 12 NCF over this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/7wkc0r/review_4_aberlour_12_double_cask_matured/
Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured ,"Info: Received as a wedding gift, 43% abv","Color: amber +1, slightest orange tinge","Nose: Initially I get spices and sweetness, cinnamon sugar (like a candied almond), coriander, muted sherry, orange syrup, apple sauce.

Gentle suggestions of sherry and fruit with a malty backbone. Perhaps some apricot or peach notes.

Heavy wood spices which fade after a minute with a more gentle tannic raisin flavor remaining, slightly over brewed tea.",Conclusions: This carries the standard profile I've come to know of the double matured Speysider.

Aberlour 12 Non Chill Filtered,"Nose: Figs, strawberries, and marmalade all burst out at first, undoubtedly because of Aberlour’s sherry sherryness, but beneath are surprising notes of cream and vanilla extract.  High tea, anyone?","Body: A tad thin, and much thinner than the 12 NCF, but still with a reasonable enough heft and weight that it isn’t out of character as an Aberlour.  Perhaps a slight negative, but not an overly detrimental one.","Palate: Plenty of fruit, especially grapes and cherries, are present, but in a fruit tart sort of taste, since there are hints of spice flavors as well, like nutmeg, cinnamon, or even gingersnap.","Finish: The creaminess from the nose makes an encore appearance, along with some leafier botanical notes as the finish tapers out into a medium linger.  Not terribly complex, but enjoyable just the same.","Price: USD $37 at my local liquor store.  Worth every penny if you’re in the market for an entry-level sherrybomb, or you want a daily drinker with more character than the big supermarket brands.","Overall: This isn’t a bad whisky by any means, but it’s sort of the Laphroaig 10 of sherried whiskies, by which I mean it’s a young expression that hits you hard with its main flavor.  But unlike similar products from larger distilleries, Aberlour 12 at least tries to offer a trifle of depth, whereas its competitors are largely one-trick ponies.  For this, it gets a more favorable final tally than it otherwise would have.  83/100","Nose: Grapes, dates, and figs leap out first from the sherry—this is Aberlour, after all—and some grain or wheat beneath it, like you’re munching on toast with jam for breakfast, except way better.","Body: A lot of depth and texture, which, on top of the lack of chill filtration, the higher ABV compared to the standard 12 probably helps with.  Syrupy, but not too overly so—simply full and rounded in feel.  Very enjoyable.","Palate: The jam and sherry from the nose continues, but are joined by flavors of molasses, maple, blackberries, strawberries, and plums.  It’s not enough to simply call it “fruity;” I could detect a lot of different individual fruit flavors, and they interacted together quite pleasantly and with seemingly little effort.  I’m reviewing this in September, but really, it’d be soooooo on point during the winter.","Finish: Smooth with a slight burn, decidedly above average for a 12 year old scotch.  Lingers a decent length and tapers out into a final burst of jammy sweetness at the very end, which was a rather satisfying note to end the dram on.  Let this be a lesson: chill filtration makes scotch worse.","Price: USD $55 in my neighborhood and roughly the same online, which I think is an entirely reasonable price point for the quality and depth of what you’re getting.  The standard 12 is, like I said, in the $35-40 neighborhood and represents a decent bang-for-buck buy in its own right, but really, these are two different whiskies and are priced accordingly.","Overall: This is, like the Old Pulteney 12, one of the best exhibits of evidence that age isn’t the be-all, end-all with scotch, and that you can still get an excellent whisky without shelling out for the increasingly pricey 15-21 year old expressions.  The layers of depth in the palate and the smoothness of the finish speak to the quality that electing to not chill filter can impart, and makes it a decidedly superior product to the standard 12.  Definitely not a scotch for those of you who don’t care for the sherry-crazed potions that Aberlour concocts, but otherwise, definitely worth a go.  89/100",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3l1n7n/reviews_7_8_aberlour_12_and_aberlour_12_ncf/

Aberlour 12 Non Chill Filtered,"Method: .5 oz at a time, and 2.5oz total for each review. I revisited it across 5 nights to get the best perspective that wasn't tainted from one day.",Content: 43%,"Region: Highland, Scotland","Nose: Green apples at the forefront with charcoal on the edge of the smell. Very sweet and sour, that is accompanied by an almost floral element.","Taste: This is super smooth throughout, almost to an extent where it’s hard to analyze at times. A sweetness at first that leads into subtle sour green apples. The apples give way about half way through the “taste”, which turns to charcoal notes and a light oaky spice. ","Finish: Both sour and sweet elements carry over, hanging onto a bit of the charcoal note as well. The floral notes in the nose come back here at the end of the taste, but I can’t put my finger on any particular flower names….it is just floral. A decent yet light mouth feel. The flavor lingers for 1-2 minutes.",Rating: 84/100,"Summary: I’ve had my ups and downs with this Scotch. Overall it’s a pretty low key and is trying to be as inoffensive as possible. It’s very simple, its major elements are sweet, and it doesn’t really leave a characteristically defining impact on me. This is what I imagine an “okay” lowland would taste like, which is one style I have yet to actually try. Out of everything I currently have, this is where I would start someone new to Scotch tasting.",Content: 40%,"Region: Speyside, Scotland","Nose: Overall a light nose, with white grapes and green apples being the primary elements. Certainly some charcoal influence coming at the end. It rings of sweetness.","Taste: Really smooth and light from the start, the green apples certainly take the forefront with only hint of sweet grapes at the edge of the flavor. The fruitiness gives way to a nice and bit heavier charcoal element that leaves as quickly as it arrived. ","Finish: Aftertaste is rich but un-abrasive, with vanilla, mild spiced cinnamon (certainly of sherry origin) and a background of oak. It is a pronounced aftertaste, but lingers for only about 1-2 minutes. Very little mouth feel, but there is some. ",Rating: 88/100,"Summary: This is nice, if a bit simple. I wouldn’t actually call it simple, the small elements of bourbon and sherry influence save it from that fate, but it’s not very complex, however in Macallan fashion it embraces the flavor profile it does have in stride. This has its place when you want something low key yet has some character going on in the background. ",Content: 43%,"Region: Speyside, Scotland","Nose: Grapes and apples to about equal degrees, with maybe a touch of cherry. A spiciness that wraps itself nicely into the initial fruit aroma, with a lingering oak background. It’s nice, not too overwhelming but certainly appetizing. ","Taste: Starts right out holding none of its cards back, with a nice “sizzling” spice that is accompanied by sweet apples, grapes and cinnamon. Honestly it could have more complex/evolving flavors in it, but the flavor profile it does present, it embraces with solid and complementary notes. ","Finish: The spice and cinnamon hang around in force while the fruit flavors fade off giving rise to the previously understated oak notes. This has a good mouth feel that isn’t too intense, but is intense enough to make itself known on the tongue. The flavor hangs in your mouth for a good 2-3 minutes, certainly satisfying. ",Rating: 91/100,"Summary: I really like this Scotch, it’s not trying to be the most complex or intricate masterpiece but it is amazingly solid at what it is trying to do and embraces what it brings to the table. It is refined enough to sit and analyze, but casual enough to be a daily drinker. Out of all my Sherry Scotches, if I HAD to pick one to keep around as an “affordable” drinker it would be this (let’s hope it never comes to that)!",Content: 43%,"Region: Speyside, Scotland","Nose: Sweet fruits galore, a bit hard to peg down but cherry, apples, grapes and some berry I can’t put my finger on. The sherry spice is deep and prevalent much more so then the 12, and stings the nostrils (in a good way). Similar to the spice being upped, so is the oak that is much more available in the overall aroma. ","Taste: Delightful sherry note that is deep and lasting with a strong spice that rings on the tongue with a notable oak flavor that rides the edge of the spice. This “evolves” into its flavors with much more grace then the 12, and the grapes, apples, and cherry notes come in towards the second half of the flavor.","Finish: The spice, oak, and fruits are pronounced but do not replace one another as the flavor evolves over time, everything mingles together into a delightful complete taste. The mouth feel is much more prevalent and hot on the tongue, and without a decent enough amount of time could very quickly numb it. The flavor lingers for easily 3-4 minutes plus.",Rating: 95/100,"Summary: This is really spectacular and exactly what I was expecting out of a “high end” Scotch. Complexity that leaves me entirely fulfilled while keeping every element of said complexity in the aftertaste to be enjoyed for as long as possible. This stuff is pretty expensive and is not something I would ever drink daily, but boy do I wish I could.",Content: 58.4%,"Region: Speyside, Scotland","Nose: A very vibrant and rich aroma with elements of caramel, spice, hot cinnamon, sweet grapes, red apples, and cherry. Very powerful, and a few good whiffs leave a mild sting/numbness in the nose which is really great.","Taste: A bit of toffee right before a hot cinnamon and spice blast, intense but not overboard. It doesn’t take long for the most intense part to pass, where afterwards come in caramel, a myriad of different apples but mainly red, sweet grapes, a bit of cherry, a tinge of bitter on the tongue. All the flavors are very deep, and I wouldn’t say one of them takes the “background” roll. All very upfront and in your face.","Finish: Hot spice lingers on the tongue, with a nice oak note coming through now. Along with it are cinnamon and apples ringing on the tongue, a very vibrant and deep mouth feel. The taste lingers for 3-4 minutes plus. A bit of numbing of the tongue which I love.",Rating: 95/100,"Summary: Wow, this is superb! I don’t think it’s as evolving in taste as the 18, but all of its flavors are much more powerful and rich. I really enjoy Macallan for their focus on hot spice notes, and boy does this have it in force. I hunted down the last two bottles I could find locally, and I’m glad I did. I can only hope it comes back into production sometime. This along with the A’bunadh make me wish more distilleries would consistently release cask strength batches.

Not very impressed with the palate here, very lacking and somewhat in-line with the simple nose","Finish:  Peppered apple, sour citrus, hot and fast on the palate, fades leaving a pepper flavor and a zing of light burnt sugar.

After my tasting last night I would probably bump it up to 79/100. It's not a terrible malt, but not amazing either.

Succulent dark fruits like boysenberry jam or blackberry cobbler, notes of dark chocolate and pepper with oak underneath. ",Color: Dark red/brown amber,"Nose: Powerful, wet oak, big sherry, very sweet and fruity, ripe dark fruits, airy malt","Taste: Explosive punchy sherry, smuckers strawberry syrup, nutmeg, ripe plum, dark chocolate below spicy cinnamon and damp oak, slight bitterness - Enjoyable but that bitter note loses a few points for me.","Finish: Succulent dark fruit, little peppery warm finish - Powerful full-bodied and long finish",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1lnq5h/aberlour_reviews_12_12ncf_abunadh_batch_30_40/

Aberlour 12 Non Chill Filtered,Nose: Raspberries with cream. Shortbread. Then darker fruits...dates or figs? A little cereal grain.  Just a whiff of ethanol. ,"Taste:  A little surprising heat. The red fruits, vanilla and shortbread are there, blending like a raspberry, vanilla custard tart.  But then some oak shows up, lending some wood spice and tannin. ","Finish:  Rather warming. Somehow a Scotch at 48% can be more warming than Bourbon at over 50%. Quite long, sweet cereal and creamy berries. Muted, like a creamsicle is to oranges, but with raspberry. Really nice. ","Conclusion:  Turned out more interesting with the side by side. I really like the Aberlour 12 NCF, but I gained some respect for the Macallan now on my third dram of it.  I think the Aberlour is better, it's bolder, has more aggressive flavors (Sherry in particular) and a bit more alcohol punch. But I can see why people like the Macallan.  It's flavors were woven together a little better and it has no missteps. The finish was probably the biggest gap, with the Aberlour winning there. Nose, slight edge to Aberlour and taste was about a tie.  Scores: B+ at 88 for Aberlour NCF and a high B at 86/100 for the Macallan.

Calling it baby A'Bunadh wouldn’t be a stretch as it shares a lot of the same qualities, flavors are similar  although its big brother is  more flavorful. I do think I prefer this over the double cask but I would have to try the double cask again to confirm that. The sherry influence seems stronger than the likes of Macallan or Glenmorangie, I get more fruity flavors in the NCF, I don’t know if they are using first fill casks or they are giving more than the usual sherry rinse prior to bottling. When I picked this up I grabbed the last bottle off of the shelf, apparently it has been temporarily discontinued in the US which is a shame because it stands out, hopefully it won't be too long before it reappears.

Upon adding a few drops of water, however, and let to sit another ten minutes, I found the taste to really open up.  The palate definitely has more notes of spice and pepper up front than the nose would imply, but all of the descriptions of the nose are still evident as it lingers in the mouth.  Mouth feel is very slightly oily and viscous.  I prefer a creamier feel, but with a whisky this nice, that’s hardly taking points away from the overall review.  With the addition of only a few drops of water, this whisky becomes incredibly smooth and delicious.  Very easy to drink.","Finish:  The finish is medium in length, and I find it to be a nice balance between the spice and the fruit, and then wood.  ","Line: I highly recommend this whisky.  It is sweeter and less spicy and peppery than the A’bunadh, which I found to be more complex and flavorful, but I’d say that this 16  year is more ‘drinkable’.  In fact, beware of a rapidly disappearing bottle.  This stuff is fantastic.",Edit:  I just read another review and someone said that this has caramel added for color.  Is that true?

Initially unimpressive, this one opens up gloriously. Straight in my wheel house too: straight up fruits, dessert and a balance of nuttiness with a punchy but clean palate and loaded finish. Heavy middle eastern desert influence going on. I never had a honey bomb before but this is it.

Overcome completely by nasty resinous oak-motor oil like notes. I hate the prevalence of this note and yet have no idea what actually to call it but I just chalk it up to shitty whiskey. I have a headache drinking this. Which is a shame because there are some interesting things underneath. The taste and finish is good but the nose is the most important part of the experience.

Just outstanding. ,Rating: Epic (94/100),"Nose: resinous oak and saw dust, pancake syrup, ginger, almond cookie, dried fruit cake, brown sugar and orange candy, vanilla","Taste: burnt cherry syrup, anisette, dark chocolate, caramel, nutmeg, and orange peel; medium bodied, quite a bit of tannin","Finish: long with cherry cordial, char, burnt oatmeal, cocoa, orange and a slight hint of heather","Overall: Well done. Much better then the Aberlour but not as great as the Pedro Berinnes and Macallan. The nose starts off with some yucky resinous oak character but that fades as it opens up. What's left is a good nose, solid taste and OK finish. Even with its flaws, it ends up being pretty much on par with any other good sherried dram but I wouldn't rush to the store. ",Rating: Damn Good (84/100),Conclusion: It looks like any whiskey matured with Pedro Ximenez sherry casks are worth your trouble. Oloroso on the other hand makes run of the mill whiskey and could potentially ruin it.

Aberlour A'bunadh,"Nose: Nosed neat this is a dram that will come at you hard.  Not purely alcohol, but big, fruity, sherry notes.  Big notes of cherry, plum and raisins complemented by a lively honey and toffee sweetness.  Recommend taking down the ABV with a bit of water to let some of the subtler notes come through.  With water the spice on the nose really comes alive, with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice making an appearance.  Hints of chocolate and candied ginger also make an appearance.","Palate: Oof, this is a banger!  The palate doesn’t contain a lot of mystery after the experience of the nose.  Incredibly rich and creamy, slightly oily and viscous, it delivers fully on the nose’s sherry bomb promise.  The cherry from the nose is present, but less pronounced, allowing those darker, dried-fruit notes to really come to the fore.  Raisins, figs, plums and pear really steal the show.  The honey/molasses sweetness and light chocolate notes remain, but don’t overwhelm or hold a candle to the fruit.  Through the development the spicy background notes come to the fore, with the cinnamon and nutmeg carrying you through the fading sweetness of the arrival.","Finish:  Long, lingering and satisfying.

With water: blueberry muffins, raisins, raspberries, the whole sherried kit-and-kaboodle all perfectly tempered. ","Taste: The front palate is sweet and chewy red fruit, sharp cherry, then it shifts to the backpalate and BOOOOOM! the fiery depths of hell build in my throat; hot hot cherries and chilli and burning mouth tissue. With water, lots and lots of water: it's calmed down a bit but there's still a fiery end to every sip.","Overall: Even after so many cask strength whiskies from the SMWS, Australian whisky in the 70% ABV area, and just general experience with high ABV whisky, the heat on this is just too much. The nose by itself is quite extraordinary and of high quality, but enjoyment falls apart for me 5 seconds after taking a sip.

Aberlour A'bunadh batch #38,Colour: Dark Amber,"Nose: Raisins, red grapes, chocolate, vanilla, sweet caramel, creme brulee ","Taste: Starts with a quick bite of cinnamon that quickly fades into a smooth mouth feel despite the high alcohol content. I get raisins, raspberries, double cream and a warm chocolate fondant.","Finish: A long smooth, warm finish with toffee, chocolate cake and raisins.",Overall: This is a wonderful whisky! I tend to find that the non Islay whiskies fail to deliver on promising noses and usually have a bland finish. This A'bunadh on the other hand delivers everywhere. Fantastic.,Colour: Dark Amber,"Nose: Raisins, nutmeg, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate ","Taste: Spices galore with cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Reminds me of ginger biscuits with under currents of raisins and berries.","Finish: A medium long finish with the spices coming through again, mostly cinnamon and ginger. Fades to raisins and berries. May not appear to last quite as long because of the initial spice hit that then fades away, but you can still taste hints of raisins for quite a while afterwards.",Overall: A great whisky that hints in the nose of the spice that it is about to deliver on the palate.,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/18dfck/aberlour_abunadh_batch_38_39_face_off_review_5_6/
Aberlour A'bunadh batch #39,"Nose: Sherried notes hit first, and hard (Don’t even have my nose in the glencairn)! Deep fruits, almost a tangy orange note. The fruits settle down into raspberries and citrus. A floral note comes out after some time in the glass.",Palate: Nice solid mouthfeel. Slightly oily. Oak notes behind fruity sweetness. Spices develop faintly. Herbs and strawberries develop near the end.,Finish: Medium-Long. The strawberry stays from the palate. Orange notes fade in and out. A menthol note appears near the end and sums up the finish quite nicely. ,"Conclusion: A well-balanced malt, as it seems both cask types suit the spirit well. However, the notes on the palate seem faint compared to the powerful nose on this one. A great beginning dram, but it has some untapped potential. I’m extremely interested in the 12 year, NCF offering, as it might unleash some of this potential.",Score: 84/100,"Nose: Sherry notes, red currants, red grapes, dates. Berry medley, with distinct strawberry and raspberry notes providing a sweet/sour balance. Candied sugars. Very slight hint of oak. I love this nose. Let’s see if the palate and finish live up to it.","Palate: Creamy malt. Sherried candies, almost like a blend between strawberries and toffee. Sun-dried raisins. Citrus notes come out. The mouthfeel is jammy, heavy, and thick. The high proof provides a nice tingle, quite like the menthol in the 12 year double cask.",Finish: A long lasting finish. Cherries come out and blend together with a nice citrus note of lemons and oranges. Sugared rock candies top off the finish with a sublime sweetness.,"Conclusion: A beautiful malt. Hands down one of my favorite malts. The palate tastes a little young with that creamy malt note, but this whisky is crafted around that sweetness. Everything seems sculpted to have a proper place. If something seems too sweet, a tad bit of sourness brings it back into equilibrium. The finish and the palate truly live up to the nose and leave me wanting to come back to this dram and discover if I’ve missed anything (I have!).

Aberlour A'bunadh batch #39,"Color: Rich amber, almost a burgundy color","Nose: Sweet Sherry…. Caramel, Vanilla, some light fruit, Twizzler’s","Taste: Like most of the other Highland’s I’ve tried the raisin hits me up first.  Not as overpowering as in the Dalmore 12 though… this is better.  Again caramel and vanilla, a nuttiness I can’t quite place, given the nose and the aging exclusively in Sherry casks I expected it to be sweeter but there isn’t much there in sweetness.  Light fruit comes and goes as I let this one spend more time in my mouth, cranberry, so orange-ish perhaps…. Perfume-y scent of flowers… almost like old ladies perfume… you know what I’m talking about… the old women that walk by you in the grocery store and you can actually taste the perfume they have on?  kind of like that.. only not disgusting.  ","Finish: long and smooth.  The raisin revisits at the end with just a hint of the alcohol, followed quickly but an almost burnt vanilla flavor that gives way to slowly dissipating light fruit, no sign of the floral notes in the finish for me.",Taste: 64/75 – I am not crazy on the raisin but it wasn’t bad,Value: 7/15 – for what it costs there are much better drams for the same price,"Uniqueness: 2/5 – of all the Highland whisky’s I have had this one fits right in with that same flavor profile, nothing really that jumps out at me","Again: 1/5 – again, there are much better drams in the same price range",Total: 74/100,"Thoughts:  Overall this was a solid dram.  Given its cost it is unlikely I will ever buy it again, but it was good.  It reminded me of the Oban 14 but with a lot more kick and floral notes to it.  I thought for sure it was going to be sweeter than what it was.  The rich color, the Oloroso casks, I was certain it would be sweet… but it just wasn’t.  I don’t in anyway see the comparison of this to the Macallan 12… or even the CS.  It was extremely smooth given the high proof and adding a little bit of filtered water did little for the overall flavor.  The water brought out some of the extra floral notes but that was about it for me… it lost the kick that I thought actually made the whisky good with the water added (I used a pipette so I am fairly certain I didn’t add too much!).  I found this one very drinkable and nice, but as I stated previously, for ~$70 I can get much better bottles. ",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/s0uat/review_aberlour_abunadh_batch_39/

Fruits, pears, apples and then fades (or is it overtaken?) into a peppery spice.",Finish: Nothing too crazy. Medium Length. Sugary apples fading out to leave a huge pepper taste. Not a great finish.,Color: Add some ruby to the 12yr.,Nose: Very similar to the 12yr. Seems like it has picked up some more vanilla or toffee notes though.,Taste: Very smooth. The pepper has lost its overpowering kick here. The woody/oaky elements come out more with the extra aging. Hints of that vanilla like a bourbon.,Finish: Just a better finish than the 12yr. More robust sherry with the vanilla that steps aside slowly for the pepper to creep in to leave a warm longer finish.,Color: Deep deep red amber.,Nose: The high ABV gave me some trouble here. I got big sherry notes (obviously). Oranges. Earthy/woody notes.,"Taste: It is almost as if someone took a dried fruit medley (prunes, dates, raisins etc) and just removed most of the sugar.

After my tasting last night I would probably bump it up to 79/100. It's not a terrible malt, but not amazing either.

Aberlour A'bunadh batch #44,"Color: damn amazing. Seriously, this is a deep Carmel that shows off beautifully. Almost reddish hue here in the bottle. ","Nose: oaky richness, raisin, fresh cut apples, burnt brown sugar","Taste: simply put, incredible. There's a deep raisin flavor here that sucks me in like no other scotch. It's that flavor you get when you bite into the raisin and it releases that intensely sweet, fragrant flavor. Strong sherry notes here, but also a cooling mint flavor starts to develop on the tongue the longer you let it sit (water tends to bring out the mint even more, I've noticed)","Finish: long and intense. It's not until the finish that you really begin to realize that this single malt is an intense 120 proof. On the nose and tongue, the alcohol doesn't overpower like you might expect it to. But on the finish, it'll surprise you. It's not harsh, it's just a long intense finish that warms your body and releases more of that soft minty flavor to contrast the sweet sherry notes. I love it. ","Summary: this is, hands down, my favorite bottle to date. Classic Speyside flavors turned up to eleven.  Some have said batch 44 is hit or miss, but I must say that this bottle is a massive hit.

Not picking up on spices right off the bat, but some tartness or sourness lingering somewhere in the background?  On a second sniff, still sherry, but the sourness or tartness has transformed into more of a citrusy praline concoction.  Sherry notes are very deep, and for lack of better words, seems to swirl and brood on the nose.

Coats the tongue very smoothly, and chewy.  Orange is there with semi-sweet chocolate  (For those who are familiar with Lindt, imagine their orange filled bar but with their 70% chocolate instead of milk).  It is just smokey enough to add mystery.","Finish:  Spice.  Not in the common, ""this has heat way"" but in a rich, flavorful way.

Aberlour A'bunadh batch #45,"Color: Medium caramel color, borderline mahogany.","Nose: At first, the nose on this whisky is a freight train of sherry and alcohol burn. After sitting for a few minutes, the symphony of notes really begin to emerge. Oak, orange rind, vanilla, nutmeg, rye spice, raisins, even the candi sugar of a Belgian dubbel all take part in a sweet, heavy, and complex aroma.  This brings back memories of some of the really great bourbons I've sampled.","Body: Thick, viscous mouthfeel without the slickness I would equate with oiliness.","Palate: The high alcohol content of the a'bunadh in my opinion does little to detract from the flavor; instead, it adds a pleasant and complementary warmth. Sherry, oak, vanilla, cocoa, ginger, clove, candied cashew, cherry, and dark chocolate are all present. Although I gravitate towards peatier whiskies, this is absolutely gorgeous.","Finish: Warm, lingering, oaky, and only slightly bitter.

I ordered it in a bar and the bartender came back with a nearly empty bottle.  He drained the bottle and there was about half a shot, so he didn't charge me.

I get a hint of cherries? as well as definite spices and I think toffee.  The high ABV can make it a little difficult to differentiate everything (at least for me).  Definitely one to drink by itself as it will overpower any food you wish to consume.","Finish: Luxurious, long and warming from the inside out.

Very sweet and sour, that is accompanied by an almost floral element.","Taste: This is super smooth throughout, almost to an extent where it’s hard to analyze at times. A sweetness at first that leads into subtle sour green apples. The apples give way about half way through the “taste”, which turns to charcoal notes and a light oaky spice.

Certainly some charcoal influence coming at the end. It rings of sweetness.","Taste: Really smooth and light from the start, the green apples certainly take the forefront with only hint of sweet grapes at the edge of the flavor. The fruitiness gives way to a nice and bit heavier charcoal element that leaves as quickly as it arrived.

I wouldn’t actually call it simple, the small elements of bourbon and sherry influence save it from that fate, but it’s not very complex, however in Macallan fashion it embraces the flavor profile it does have in stride. This has its place when you want something low key yet has some character going on in the background.

","Taste: Starts right out holding none of its cards back, with a nice “sizzling” spice that is accompanied by sweet apples, grapes and cinnamon. Honestly it could have more complex/evolving flavors in it, but the flavor profile it does present, it embraces with solid and complementary notes. ","Finish: The spice and cinnamon hang around in force while the fruit flavors fade off giving rise to the previously understated oak notes. This has a good mouth feel that isn’t too intense, but is intense enough to make itself known on the tongue. The flavor hangs in your mouth for a good 2-3 minutes, certainly satisfying. ",Rating: 91/100,"Summary: I really like this Scotch, it’s not trying to be the most complex or intricate masterpiece but it is amazingly solid at what it is trying to do and embraces what it brings to the table. It is refined enough to sit and analyze, but casual enough to be a daily drinker.

The sherry spice is deep and prevalent much more so then the 12, and stings the nostrils (in a good way). Similar to the spice being upped, so is the oak that is much more available in the overall aroma. ","Taste: Delightful sherry note that is deep and lasting with a strong spice that rings on the tongue with a notable oak flavor that rides the edge of the spice. This “evolves” into its flavors with much more grace then the 12, and the grapes, apples, and cherry notes come in towards the second half of the flavor.","Finish: The spice, oak, and fruits are pronounced but do not replace one another as the flavor evolves over time, everything mingles together into a delightful complete taste.

I tried a small pour of the 105 a little while afterwards to compare and I feel that it handles the high strength a little better than the A'bunadh, which was quite sharp at times.

I'll be honest, the first couple times I smelled this dram, I couldn't help but sigh, it was THAT delicious smelling. I'm also picking up the astringent, tanniny notes. Which is interesting considering that it is a sherry finish. The sherry is also very full in the nose, as well as a floral note. Not sure what though... for some reason my mind goes to buttercups, but I am not quite sure if that's the case or not. Dark chocolate fills the ""finish"" of the nose, with a beet undertone. Very complex. ","Taste: First thought: OH WOW IS THIS GOOD!!!  Ok, now for the breakdown lol. I get something reminiscent of white tea at the onset. There is also a berry/plum, date/raisin from the nose present, in a definite maltiness swimming in brown sugar. It's sweet... more than I expected, even knowing it to be sherry finished. I also get a spiciness (cloves?) as well as a unique riciness. Like a good, dry sake. Speaking of Japanese cuisine, I also get hints of mackerel nigiri, but just the pickled fish part, minus the rice. It's not fishiy, thought... if you take away the fishiness, the taste behind it is what I mean. Again, not sure if that made sense, but it is DAMN tasty. Obviously, in all of this, there is a definite sherry tone tying it all together.

Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #52,"Color: I don’t usually note anything, but the A’bunadh definitely has a richer color even though it is (I read) uncolored. ","Nose: Heavy alcohol, raisins, prunes, loads of cinnamon, maybe allspice, cake of some kind. With water, the spice deepens if anything, a hint of burnt matches","Nose: Strong alcohol, burnt matches, tangerines, a little wax. Not much difference with water.","Palate: Comparatively mild despite the slightly higher ABV. Plum cake, hazelnuts, cinnamon buns, a tangy note of something, molasses. With water: the rough edges are smoothed down, a little sweeter and nuttier. There's serious depth to the flavor. Really tasty. ","Palate: Very hot initially. Orange marmalade, walnut fudge, a little honey, something floral I can't really place. The alcohol is quite overpowering. With water: less harsh and more chocolatey, not quite as much orange, maybe something like date nut bars.","Finish: Long and warm, more cinnamon buns, plum sauce, a little espresso, not too sweet, not too bitter.","Finish: Long, sweet, orange creamsicle, honey and walnuts, sort of like a granola bar. Burnt matches poke through again. Quite astringent. ","Conclusion: Both are good, but I'll have to give the nod to the A'bunadh. The fudge notes in the Glenfarclas are very nice, but ultimately the greater complexity in nose and finish put A'bunadh ahead in my opinion. Unfortunately I finished up my GlenDronach CS a while back so I couldn't do a three-way comparison (considering the ABV on those it might be for the best that I couldn't), but I think I'd put A'bunadh slightly ahead of that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4w6x25/reviews_3031_battle_of_the_cask_strength_sherry/

Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #53,Price: $99 at the LCBO,Region: Speyside,Abv: 59.7%,Colour: like an English ale,"Nose: neat - spices, typical sherry red fruits. Very solid nose and true to form for what I would expect in a Sherry bomb. Hits that comfort spot. Breathing in deeply I get some woody notes, some light toffee sweetness and a hint of a floral perfume. Without water it's very approachable, especially considering this is 59.7%. I was getting this really sweet note that I couldn't identify at first but I think it's candy apple.",Taste: neat - very spicy with the same Sherry notes underneath that dominating spice. Some wood. This is a bit closed so I think it would benefit from some water. ,"Finish: oak, spice, dry and toffee. Medium long length and very drying. Very standard but solid finish. ","Thoughts: this is everything I would want in a Sherry bomb. Hits all the notes I would expect. Very spicy dram and sometimes it detracts from the great Sherry notes. In Ontario, this is a great value for money. My baseline right now for Sherry bombs would be the GlenDronach Single Casks or GlenDronach Cask Strength. This doesn't hit those levels but it's a good dram, very ""text book"" and I would be happy to have a bottle if not for all the fantastic Single Casks out there. The juicy notes that started to appear after some time and water really are my favourite part and elevates it above ""just a Sherry bomb"". ",Price: $110 at the LCBO,Region: Speyside,Abv: 60.0%,Colour: warmed honey,"Nose: Very strong and syrupy red fruit, like maraschino cherry syrup.  Mulling spice and a bit of sherry funk.  Exactly what you would expect from a sherry bomb, with some more emphasis on the cherry, as opposed to the A’bunadh.","Taste: cherries, vanilla, mulling spices. Surprisingly dry when compared to the nose, which was very syrupy.  With time the cherry syrup is more dominant.","Finish: drying, some oak, cherries, vanilla, spices. ","Thoughts: Not complex overall and really hits your textbook sherry notes, but what it does hit, it does so with a vengeance.  I do love the tilt towards cherry.  The selling point for me is the intensity of flavours.  Admittedly, it is a far cry from the more complex sherried drams I’ve had, such as the Glendro Single Casks but I’m not complaining and if price were no issue I’d take this just over the A’bunadh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4rurz0/review_s_2730_sherry_bomb_horizontal_aberlour/
Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #53,"Nose: Hot spice and rich sherry scents. I honestly find the nose to be the most impressive feature of A'bunadh; I breathe in deep notes of old wood, chocolate, and dried fruit. The beauty of it truly comes in with the spice that tops it off.","Palate: Bold flavors: wood, sherry, spice and fruit. With a dash of water the spice turns to syrupy goodness. Cons, if any? The youth comes across a bit by way of slightly overbearing wood flavors.","Finish: My least favorite aspect of A'bunadh - the finish is surprisingly unsatisfying relative to the nose and palate.

I have to add some water to get the abv down closer to 50% before I can get to tasting and smelling the plethora of other flavors.

Abraham Bowman Coffee Finished Bourbon,"Nose: Hot, woody, boozy coffee. I don't know if it's the ethanol or mash but there is a lot of angry, spicy heat. It smells like a barrel proof coffee liqueur. ","Taste: Everything from the nose only with more coffee influence. It is a bomb of sweet woody flavors, heat, and coffee. Like the nose it tastes like a barrel proof coffee liqueur - it's really incredible how much coffee flavor this has just from being finished in barrels that once held coffee beans. The viscosity is about as thick as you'd expect a 9ish year old 134 proof whiskey which is to say it's chewy. Again not sure if it's the ethanol or mash but there is a lot of aggressive heat spice. ","Thoughts: Whew, this one is a bruiser and not for the faint of heart. I've probably sampled out more of this bottle than I've drank and overall the crowd reactions seem split almost 50/50 on love/hate. The main negatives I can see are that it's hot, brash, and insanely coffee forward.

Abraham Bowman Double Barrel,Background: The normal Bowman juice is a redistilled version of Buffalo Trace Mashbill #2 (the same as Elmer T. Lee). This is that same juice but aged for 6-7 years in one new oak barrel and then aged in another new oak barrel for an additional year. ,"Nose: The nose is nice and spicy with notes of caramel, maple syrup, oak, black pepper, black tea, rye spice, cinnamon and a touch of something floral. The heavier oak shines through without being overwhelming. ","Mouth: Sweet tea; nutmeg; cinnamon apple; oak; brown sugar' barrel char. Compared to the light, easy drinking Bowman Brother's (or, for that matter, Elmer T. Lee) I am surprised at how much spice the 2nd oak barrel adds. This drinks more like a rye than a bourbon. The single barrel offering by Abraham Bowman---John J. Bowman---is fairly spicy but this makes that look very tame. ",Finish: Cinnamon; bitters; black pepper; chili peppers; big red chewing gum. ,Thoughts: I am always skeptical about cask finishing in a 2nd new oak barrel. It's easy to overdo the oakiness---see Woodford Reserve Double Oaked---and ruin some otherwise enjoyable flavors. This one is very spicy and full of barrel char flavors but still maintains a respectable palate. I still prefer the Bowman Brothers Small Batch and John J. Bowman Single Barrel over this but this is a decent special release I am glad to have tried. ,Rating: B,Rating: B. I got mine in a trade but I think it's usually priced around $80-100.

B+/B","Palate: Cooling, sweet rye taste, very clean though not that deep. Again the rye is front & center but the mixing spirits (or possibly low proof) fail to provide a fully rounded taste. Lightly sweet. B/B-","Finish: A little sweet, some light rye, medium-long. Again, this is a fine clean whisky B/B-","Up: Pleasingly impressed! Sure, it’s a blended whisky but it still tastes like rye, kudos old-timey whisky blenders! Glad I decided to sip this down instead of just feeding the water treatment plant. Glad I am finally starting to appreciate Canadian whisky; afterall, as a child of the Great Lakes I have long appreciated the nation & its people (not just my cousins either). 83/100","Glass: Some lightly sugary faint rye notes. Ok, could've been worse, the scent is nice but pretty faint.

Fairly long finish for 46%.",Notes: I like this and it is quite inoffensive.  Pretty much a good warm up for the drams to come.,Region: Speyside,Abv: 46.2%,"Nose: Strawberry hard candies, Glenfarclas grassy character, mint, dried strawberry, vanilla, nutmeg.  This comes through much stronger and juicier than your standard OB 15.  With time get some caramel and powdered sugar.","Taste: Strawberry, shisito peppers, mineral note to balance it all out.  Grass.  Continuing the trend from the nose this is much better than the OB 15. The intensity of the notes comes through so well and is the highlight factor.  Not a super amount of complexity here.","Finish: Less sweet here than on the nose and taste.  Red fruits, standard grass note and Barbecued pork chops.  ",Notes: I don’t think it really needs to be repeated but this is much better than the standard 15.  The intensity and the juiciness coming through are really impressive.

Red fruits, red hots, tropical fruits (mangosteen, pineapple, mango)","Finish: Astringent, tobacco leaves, pineapple-coconut juice.  Bit of char.

Really my scoring here is a shot in the dark. ,Region: Scotland & Japan,Abv: 48.6%,"Nose: Apple blossoms, orange blossoms, asian spices.  Underlying this all is asian pear.  Apple juice, condensed milk cheesecake, yuzu.","Taste: Very nice body and astringency.  Fruit covered cheesecake, spices, floral, sweet, flambeed banana.","Finish: Condensed milk, spices, peppers, fruit roll-up, toasted wood chips.

Quite rich, lots of malt depth.","Finish: Mild peat on the finish, slightly earthy, very slightly musty wood, medium length.","Notes: I would guess this is around 43-46 ABV. I'm not sure this could be an Islay, as the peat is too subtle. The profile of this immediately reminded me of Jura, so probably a peated Jura, possibly superstition... I don't think it's peated enough to be prophecy. I definitely get some sherry cask influence, but I don't think it's exclusive sherry.

Very nicely balanced with quite a bit of depth.","Finish: Delicate white fruit, some peppery wood, after 10 seconds, there's some nuttyness, almost green unroasted nuts. Fairly long.","Notes: I would guess this is 40-43 ABV. It tastes heavily or exclusively bourbon cask matured. Probably a speyside, but I can't name the distillery. What I really like about this one, is that normally your fruit speyside whiskies lack a certain depth or body; this one does not. It's light, fruity, but it has balls. Reveal: Adelphi “Fascadale” Batch 5 – Highland Park 12 years old @ 46%, bottled in 2012. Very interesting.

The finish is the weakest part of this dram.","Notes: This tastes like another Speyside to me. The profile is odd enough to make me wonder if this might be a white wine cask, as there is something abstract in the taste that I can't quite pin down, but it reminds me of some other white wine finished whiskies I've had. I would swear this is almost slightly peated, as it has a very bare hint of vegetal/earthiness, but I don't believe it is. Bruichladdich 16 years old – French Wine Finish Series @ 46%.

In the upper eschelons of blends in this price range (JW Black, Chivas Regal, Grouse etc).  As far as blends go, this is very good, but for $10 more you are now into single malt territory.

Menthol, pine, and anise spice are very noticeable even from the start of the palate.

Alberta Premium,"Appearance: Approaching amber? Which, considering its age, is no doubt the result of caramel colouring. Surprising legs for a young, 40% ABV whisky, though.","Nose: At first, your standard Canadian whisky nosing notes: vanilla, toffee, maple syrup. Oaky. But better integrated than the maple-vanilla oak bombs of other Canadian whiskies. It’s a lot more . . . natural, if that makes sense? And the alcohol is surprisingly muted for a 5 year old bottling, and the rye spiciness is there in the background. A farm field in fall, and some cereal drift in and out, but they’re so ephemeral it’s hard to say I’m not imagining things. Distant grass. Light fruits—berries, especially. Honey. Water doesn’t seem to have much of an effect, save for perhaps bringing out a bit more of the rye spice. Slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so in the manner of other Canadian whiskies.","Taste: Exceptionally smooth for a 5 year old whisky. There’s still a bit of fire there, but it’s much more subdued than the burn that accompanies the standard Canadian whisky offerings (Canadian Club, Crown Royal, even the 12 Year Old Wiser’s). The rye is a lot more apparent on the palate. Spicy grain mingle with vanilla and maple oak. Honey. Again, slightly sweet, but with enough spicy and woody dryness to offer some balance. Give it some time, and there’s actually a bit of berried sweetness. Not complex by any means, but balanced, smooth and enjoyable.","Finish: Short. Some spicy rye and vanilla, but this stuff is clearly manufactured for smoothness (and more power to it for that). Nice balance of sweet and spice.","Thoughts: I can’t say that I ever really see myself sipping this stuff, but it’s enjoyable, and it’s absolutely worth giving credit where credit’s due by acknowledging that Alberta Premium is miles ahead of the standard big-name Canadian whisky bottling. It outshines CC, Crown Royal, and Wiser’s—and does so for about $5 less per bottle. I’ll probably enjoy it on the rocks (is that sacrilegious to say here?) just because that’s how I grew up drinking Canadian whisky, but this stuff really does hold its own neat—better than it has any right to, anyway. Not complex, but smooth and offers a well-integrated overview of the typical Canadian whisky taste notes (with just a little extra spicy rye thrown in for good measure). Cheap enough that it’s absolutely worth a try if you can find it, but it’s a shame that Beam has decided not to export it for international markets—because it represents the potential of a (usually much-maligned) style of whisky much better than the brand-name titans.",Score: 81,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/11fzg5/review_alberta_premium_canadian_whisky/c6m48ec

The finish is hot, white pepper, rye, astringent, dry (wine), camphor plays peek-a-boo. Nice and long. ","Comparisons: Far more complex than Double Barrel Reserve from 40 Creek which is extremely basic and “meh” when pitted against this dram.

Sweet, dark and light fruits. Still that nice mix of sweetness with a tang. Molasses (or brown sugar, maybe?). Licorice out of nowhere. Again, delightful. For the price point, fabulous. Water seems to bring out the fruitiness (raisins, especially) and the rye character a bit more—both the actual quality of the grain and the spiciness of it, but I think this guy might be preferable without.","Finish: Doesn’t go on forever, but respectable. Some nice spice, and oak tannins. Faint smoke, and charcoal. Woodchips. Berries and dried, dark fruits after a bit.","Thoughts: I’m two-for-two on Canadian whisky purchases this past couple of weeks. Tasty, robust, complex while still being accessible—a good sipping whisky at an outstanding price. Much better and more complex than the entry-level Alberta Premium (even though I liked that one, too) for a couple bucks more.

My wife had previously talked about cloves and gingersnaps but today said “butterscotch and gasoline.”  I see where she gets that since there’s a faint paint thinner note that ties in with the alcohol zing, but it’s not huge or particularly unpleasant. In fact, it helps cut what would otherwise be quite – and maybe too –sweet. After a few minutes in the glass the gasoline/paint thinner is gone and it smoothes out considerably, with more of the butterscotch plus burnt sugar and caramel.","Taste: Smooth and sweet – again, maple syrup comes easily to mind but without the cloying sweetness.  It’s warm and smooth, with an oily mouthfeel that gives way to a pleasant alcohol burn.  More of the butterscotch, which is enhanced by the smooth oily feel.","Finish: The lingering alcohol burn passes and is replaced by a pleasant deeper sweetness: more of the caramel and vanilla, and the dark red fruit they talk about on the bottle is there at the back, too.  I didn’t get the smoke they talked about (maybe because I’m used to peaty Scotch) or really the sweet oak (which is fine since to me, “sweet oak” brings to mind overly buttery Chardonnay, whereas this is a nice mellow butterscotch/caramel).","Score: 92 – My highest rating yet (of three reviews).  Some of the score is definitely because of the price – I gave E.H. Taylor Barrel Proof a 90 and that’s delicious, too, and more complex for sure, but also hard to find and in the $90-100 range when I do.  I’d likely drink that one over this… but it’s a completely different beast and fills a different role in my cabinet and drinking habits.  This is available (or would be if I lived in Canada), affordable and delicious.  When I’m just sitting around having a relaxing night, lately I’ve found myself going to this more than I would most entry-level bourbons.  It’s not necessarily the most challenging or complex – which isn’t to say there’s nothing going on here – but it’s good. It would be a great drink when you need something warm and comforting in the winter; as it is, it’s 90 degrees outside and I’m still happily sipping away.  I probably sound like I’m damning with faint phrase but in fact it’s the opposite: this is what it is, and what it is is awfully good, for a great price.  My thanks to everyone who recommended I pick it up.",http://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/29l6u3/review_2_alberta_premium_dark_horse/

It's not quite as good, but has a lot of similar notes and fits the same general profile while being a very enjoyable whisky.

Something faintly herbal or medicinal. Cinnamon. Licorice (and/or black licorice?). Grape. Apple (green apple in particular). Orange peel. Pickle juice. Lumber or sawdust, maybe pencil shavings? Actually, not bad—the 40% ABV feels like a shame here, as the nose is actually pretty compelling, but could just use being turned up a notch.","Taste: Not a bad body for 40%. Sweet in a fairly typical Canadian whisky way, though not to the point of being cloying. Vanilla. Apples/apple juice. Pear juice. Grape. Slight sour pickle. Butterscotch/toffee/caramel, and the typical maple-esque note. But a nice bit of rye spice. Some cinnamon, ginger, clove. Orange peel as on the nose, or maybe Terry’s Chocolate orange. Light pepper.

Amrut Cask Strength,Price:  $11.46 CAD,"Tasted:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (neat!) and comes in a miniature canister as well.",Colour:  Amber -1.,"Nose:  It begins peppery, hot and youthful. Very sweet, molasses, honey, aloe vera, burlap sack, oak tannins in the background. Vanilla pod, heavy cream, almost like frosting. The heat wanes and a spice melange forms with time, lily pads (like… you’d find on a lake… with frogs and such), brie, white pepper, [‘70s era Old Spice after shave]( http://i.imgur.com/YTP1rG4.jpg), peach syrup, pencil shavings, teddy bear fur, and more aloe vera.","Palate:  Barley-forward. Vanilla, white pepper, butter (ghee?), raw sugar (jaggery goor?), slight hint of pear. With time it opens up into a greater mixture of spices, candle wax, the backing on lickable stamps, cotton, lemon pith, and a sort of Fisherman’s Friend taste—eucalyptus I suppose. It’s quite well balanced and put together.","Finish:  Sour and citric, warming, after a while hazelnuts, French praline, cashews, green apple, pear returns—it’s halfway between cloyingly sweet and tart. Very nice. After allowing the whisky to open up for a bit the finish becomes all wax—crayons more than candles, graphite, pencil shavings and lickable stamps. It then gets b-i-t-t-e-r. Very different. I quite like it.","Design:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. Only downside was the screwcap wouldn’t come loose of the bit that is supposed to stay on the neck of the bottle—I nearly broke the cap trying to remove it. :/","Conclusion:  At first it tasted like single malt whisky aged in an ex-bourbon cask. Not that different from anything else I’ve had, closest perhaps in character to Bruichladdich, although a bit sweeter. After a while, however, it really opened up into a bizarre combination of scents and flavours from my childhood crossed with chemicals and industrial solvents. I don’t know why, but I really dig it. Perhaps because it’s so different. It’s very easy drinking—blind I would never guess it was 46%—and I’m quite looking forward to trying the Cask Strength and Fusion miniatures that I picked up at the same time (as well as a full-sized bottle of something else in the future).",Price:  $11.46 CAD,"Tasted:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (woo) and comes in a miniature canister as well. Due to the ludicrously high ABV, I reviewed this at an adjusted 46% after adding water. Elsewise the review notes all consisted of “ow”, “ouch”, and “my god it burns”. Does this negate the point of the review? Will it be exactly the same as the normal 46% ABV Amrut offering? Read on to find out.",Colour:  Amber -2.,"Nose:  Heavy-handed spices, very reminiscent of rye whisky. Cinnamon, white pepper, cardamom, vanilla pod, and an underlying saccharine sweetness. With time the sweetness is identifiable as raw sugar (jaggery goor) crossed with coconut, and there are notes of toasted sesame seeds, grapeseed oil and a hint of smoke and cheese.","Palate:  Warming, spiced, pleasant—this isn’t as hot as the basic Amrut single malt with the added water, even though they’re the same ABV. Burlap notes, rice vinegar, soybean and tapioca come to the fore. With time it opens up into white pepper, dried apricot, pears in syrup, and becomes rather barley forward just like its standard 46% cousin. Notes of toasted walnuts appear, as the spice melange continues to change—leaning more towards oak spice than rye-ish spice.","Finish:  Long, oaky, slightly smoky. Very, very pleasant, but not very complex at first. Opens up into a nice citric note which is simultaneously sour and bitter, but in all the right ways. Ends with soya sauce, tamarind paste and the lingering bite of everlasting oak. With time in the glass the finish transforms completely, becoming very sweet and more like the lickable backs of stamps as found in the standard 46% offering’s palate, but with unsalted pistachios, soybean, toasted sesame and even more puckeringly tannic oak. ","Design:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. I’m getting tired of removing tax stamps though. Not sure why I was so enamored with them before.","Conclusion:  Well, if you dilute it to 46% ABV it’s similar to the standard release of Amrut Single Malt Whisky—but a much, much better version of it. It’s more balanced, but that could very well be due to this being from a better batch of casks. I’d place this one head and shoulders above the standard Amrut offering, but drinking it at 61.8% is a silly idea. I might try 50-55% and add that as an addendum to this review, but without that this stands at:  ",Price:  $11.46 CAD,"Tasted:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA.

If nosed immediately after pouring (or from the bottle) there’s a surge of phenols and peat smoke, but after sitting in the glass for a few minutes it recedes and distillery character takes centre stage: Dark chocolate, cinnamon, dark rum, figs, graham crackers, garam masala—cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, specifically. Amrut’s saccharine sweetness has turned treacle, as everything about this whisky is just darker than its brethren. With water it becomes a lovely gently peated dram, plenty of graham crackers, gingerbread, lovely soft pastry notes and peat. ","Palate:  Pickling spice, peat smoke, oak, spice increases but the pickled bit recedes—a cross of oak influence and distillery character with cinnamon, white pepper, soybean and vanilla pod. It’s hot and youthful but it doesn’t go too far. It’s quite tart and has just the right amount of prickliness—especially when paired with the peat. With water it’s much less intense: citrus, barley sugar, gentle peat smoke, oak spice and tannins. Wonderfully sour.","Finish:  Peat smoke, oak, pickle brine, vinegar, soya sauce and a spice melange. After time it progresses into something very tannic and somewhat bitter. Eventually it turns into sweet territory with caramel and pralines surrounded by subtle drawn-out peat smoke. With water… there’s nothing remarkable. It’s weak, largely non-existent.","Design:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. The cap on this one was hard to remove, nearly broke in the process, and I really do hate tax stamps. Such a pain to remove cleanly.","Conclusion:  This offering is quite different from standard Amrut releases, and the distillery character is subsumed by the peated spirit. I like the whisky just fine, but I can’t help but feel that peat didn’t offer any real improvement over the base offering—it’s a bluntly implemented flavour, and doesn’t blend harmoniously with Amrut’s usual characteristics. It noses amazingly, it tastes very nice, the finish is so-so on it, and it absolutely lacks balance. So slight docking of marks for those issues. Still a wonderful whisky, but could be better if it were wholly peated spirit, and not a mix of both styles. (I’m aware that exists. Perhaps I’ll have to try it.)

Buried under these Islay-ish notes are some fruit and oak, but they are diminished.  When I first cracked this I had a sad, since I really dislike peat bombs, but for those who enjoy peat, this nose should be a wonder.  However… let it sit.  The peat settles, and it becomes much more balanced as time progresses.  Very nuanced.","Taste: Incredible.  Every taste wrenches an emotional response.  There is a light sweetness that hits first, followed by a lush, grassy and woody smoke.  In the sweetness, I sense a touch of apple or pear, but by the time I can detect anything it is then washed over with smoke and wood.","Finish:  Long.  Quite long.

After ten minutes: better, much better indeed. Peat (still a bit musty), some smoke, underneath is that slightly tart fruitiness. Funnily enough, I also get some Indian herbs but I guess that due to weird brain-o malfunction, there is also some sweeter bourbon cask influence honey/vanilla as well as some milk chocolate notes. Quite multilayered. I had this on two nights now and even though the overall impression stays the same, there are different aspects popping up...maybe it's like the Maraba Caves and depending on in which mindset you approve it, you'll get a different experience?","Palate: creamy entry, then immediately milk chocolate, spices – most dominantly salt, oaky tannin, a bit of an underlaying tart note, peat, vanilla, traces of different herbs and some sweet malt. It's a bit flat, undefined or chaotic in a way. Might be just like India in the novel? Not bad though, not really special either.","Finish: chocolate, smoke, ashy, salt, nice! Not as intense as cask-strength Islay but still very nice. And quite long with drying tannin at the end.

Amrut Fusion,Price:  $11.46 CAD,"Tasted:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (neat!) and comes in a miniature canister as well.",Colour:  Amber -1.,"Nose:  It begins peppery, hot and youthful. Very sweet, molasses, honey, aloe vera, burlap sack, oak tannins in the background. Vanilla pod, heavy cream, almost like frosting. The heat wanes and a spice melange forms with time, lily pads (like… you’d find on a lake… with frogs and such), brie, white pepper, [‘70s era Old Spice after shave]( http://i.imgur.com/YTP1rG4.jpg), peach syrup, pencil shavings, teddy bear fur, and more aloe vera.","Palate:  Barley-forward. Vanilla, white pepper, butter (ghee?), raw sugar (jaggery goor?), slight hint of pear. With time it opens up into a greater mixture of spices, candle wax, the backing on lickable stamps, cotton, lemon pith, and a sort of Fisherman’s Friend taste—eucalyptus I suppose. It’s quite well balanced and put together.","Finish:  Sour and citric, warming, after a while hazelnuts, French praline, cashews, green apple, pear returns—it’s halfway between cloyingly sweet and tart. Very nice. After allowing the whisky to open up for a bit the finish becomes all wax—crayons more than candles, graphite, pencil shavings and lickable stamps. It then gets b-i-t-t-e-r. Very different. I quite like it.","Design:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. Only downside was the screwcap wouldn’t come loose of the bit that is supposed to stay on the neck of the bottle—I nearly broke the cap trying to remove it. :/","Conclusion:  At first it tasted like single malt whisky aged in an ex-bourbon cask. Not that different from anything else I’ve had, closest perhaps in character to Bruichladdich, although a bit sweeter. After a while, however, it really opened up into a bizarre combination of scents and flavours from my childhood crossed with chemicals and industrial solvents. I don’t know why, but I really dig it. Perhaps because it’s so different. It’s very easy drinking—blind I would never guess it was 46%—and I’m quite looking forward to trying the Cask Strength and Fusion miniatures that I picked up at the same time (as well as a full-sized bottle of something else in the future).",Price:  $11.46 CAD,"Tasted:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (woo) and comes in a miniature canister as well. Due to the ludicrously high ABV, I reviewed this at an adjusted 46% after adding water.

Read on to find out.",Colour:  Amber -2.,"Nose:  Heavy-handed spices, very reminiscent of rye whisky. Cinnamon, white pepper, cardamom, vanilla pod, and an underlying saccharine sweetness. With time the sweetness is identifiable as raw sugar (jaggery goor) crossed with coconut, and there are notes of toasted sesame seeds, grapeseed oil and a hint of smoke and cheese.","Palate:  Warming, spiced, pleasant—this isn’t as hot as the basic Amrut single malt with the added water, even though they’re the same ABV. Burlap notes, rice vinegar, soybean and tapioca come to the fore. With time it opens up into white pepper, dried apricot, pears in syrup, and becomes rather barley forward just like its standard 46% cousin. Notes of toasted walnuts appear, as the spice melange continues to change—leaning more towards oak spice than rye-ish spice.","Finish:  Long, oaky, slightly smoky. Very, very pleasant, but not very complex at first. Opens up into a nice citric note which is simultaneously sour and bitter, but in all the right ways. Ends with soya sauce, tamarind paste and the lingering bite of everlasting oak. With time in the glass the finish transforms completely, becoming very sweet and more like the lickable backs of stamps as found in the standard 46% offering’s palate, but with unsalted pistachios, soybean, toasted sesame and even more puckeringly tannic oak.

It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. I’m getting tired of removing tax stamps though. Not sure why I was so enamored with them before.","Conclusion:  Well, if you dilute it to 46% ABV it’s similar to the standard release of Amrut Single Malt Whisky—but a much, much better version of it. It’s more balanced, but that could very well be due to this being from a better batch of casks. I’d place this one head and shoulders above the standard Amrut offering, but drinking it at 61.8% is a silly idea.

If nosed immediately after pouring (or from the bottle) there’s a surge of phenols and peat smoke, but after sitting in the glass for a few minutes it recedes and distillery character takes centre stage: Dark chocolate, cinnamon, dark rum, figs, graham crackers, garam masala—cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, specifically. Amrut’s saccharine sweetness has turned treacle, as everything about this whisky is just darker than its brethren. With water it becomes a lovely gently peated dram, plenty of graham crackers, gingerbread, lovely soft pastry notes and peat. ","Palate:  Pickling spice, peat smoke, oak, spice increases but the pickled bit recedes—a cross of oak influence and distillery character with cinnamon, white pepper, soybean and vanilla pod. It’s hot and youthful but it doesn’t go too far. It’s quite tart and has just the right amount of prickliness—especially when paired with the peat. With water it’s much less intense: citrus, barley sugar, gentle peat smoke, oak spice and tannins. Wonderfully sour.","Finish:  Peat smoke, oak, pickle brine, vinegar, soya sauce and a spice melange. After time it progresses into something very tannic and somewhat bitter. Eventually it turns into sweet territory with caramel and pralines surrounded by subtle drawn-out peat smoke.

Such a pain to remove cleanly.","Conclusion:  This offering is quite different from standard Amrut releases, and the distillery character is subsumed by the peated spirit. I like the whisky just fine, but I can’t help but feel that peat didn’t offer any real improvement over the base offering—it’s a bluntly implemented flavour, and doesn’t blend harmoniously with Amrut’s usual characteristics. It noses amazingly, it tastes very nice, the finish is so-so on it, and it absolutely lacks balance. So slight docking of marks for those issues. Still a wonderful whisky, but could be better if it were wholly peated spirit, and not a mix of both styles. (I’m aware that exists. Perhaps I’ll have to try it.)

For me, the flavour profile fits right in with other mildly peated scotch whiskies, like Highland Park 12, Springbank 10, Benromach 10, and Bowmore 15. It’s got more of a floral and tropical fruit character than any of those though, without losing that weighty, peated character. To top it off, the value for money here is pretty fantastic.

Light fruits—crisp apples, maybe. Some dried fruit as well. Huge malt present. A very malty malt, if that makes sense. Vanilla. Sweet and lovely. Harvest-time. A single drop of water really kicks up the honeyed sweetness. Brown sugar.","Taste: Exceptionally smooth for a 46% ABV malt. Campfire; smoking wood. Earthy. Fruity. Lots of oak. Again, big malt.

Amrut Portonova,"Color:  Light amber, orange and pink.","Nose:  Peat is the immediate element, but it's not very intense.  Some brine, a bit of smoked pork, and salt.  Buried under these Islay-ish notes are some fruit and oak, but they are diminished.  When I first cracked this I had a sad, since I really dislike peat bombs, but for those who enjoy peat, this nose should be a wonder.  However… let it sit.  The peat settles, and it becomes much more balanced as time progresses.  Very nuanced.","Taste: Incredible.  Every taste wrenches an emotional response.  There is a light sweetness that hits first, followed by a lush, grassy and woody smoke.  In the sweetness, I sense a touch of apple or pear, but by the time I can detect anything it is then washed over with smoke and wood.","Finish:  Long.  Quite long.  Peat smoke seems to bookend the sensation that is this single malt, with a more grain and wood heavy middle.  A bit of a lush sweet grassy flavor lingers as well.  Fantastic","Color: A nice rich amber, lighter mahogany","Nose: Lots going on here.  Fruits are apparent with raisins, figs, dates and pears.  Some spices like cinnamon, a little bit of chocolate.  Licorice and nuts.  A bit of smoke and salted butter.  Decadent.  Changes over time and with bit of water.  More of the salty savory components come to the fore.","Taste: This is 124 proof?  Holy shit.  Really lovely body, the cinnamon and raisins are apparent along with some smoke and savory components.  There is indeed a little burn, but it appears more on the periphery of my mouth, with very little in the back of the throat.  With a dash of water it opens up some, and is decadently smooth.  Definitely taste more smoked meat along with the nutty raisins.  ",Finish: Salted nuts and the core raisin/cinnamon combination.  Some flavors on the finish make me recall Four Roses.

I am not getting a lot of overt PX here. Noticeable bitterness on the the way out, which detracts. Water is a must, which lightens the mouthfeel, tones down the heat, and brings up the caramel and honey. Doesn’t help with the bitterness though.","Finish: Medium. Dark chocolate. Anise.

Tons of pepper added to the cinnamon from the oak, plus anise and a fragrant herbal component (Ricola cough candies). Reasonable amount of heat, although still not as much as I expected for 62.8%.

This is not an out and out ""bourbon nose"", but definitely bourbon heavy; big time on the toffee sweets, with a big depth of body.","Taste: Huge, intense, takes 10-15 seconds to really hit you full force. Wow, so sweet; confectionary sugar, caramels, vanilla custard, golden syrup, sultanas, also a huge backbone of spice; black pepper, cinnamon, clove, tannins.

While they have all been good, I think there is a certain amount of expectation tempering, because Amrut never tends to be heavily impacted by the cask. Whether that is due to a very strong character of the base spirit or because of the accelerated aging conditions, I never get smashed in the face by the cask influence. That is, until now. The cask influence is hugely apparent here; the core Amrut profile has been infused with an amazing assortment of sweet notes, all backed up by a wonderful blast of spiciness. I'm almost tempted to call this Spicebomb, but worried I might infringe on Viktor & Rolf's trademark. This is the first Amrut release that has legitimately blown me away.

Amrut Single Malt Whisky,Price:  $11.46 CAD,"Tasted:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (neat!) and comes in a miniature canister as well.",Colour:  Amber -1.,"Nose:  It begins peppery, hot and youthful. Very sweet, molasses, honey, aloe vera, burlap sack, oak tannins in the background. Vanilla pod, heavy cream, almost like frosting. The heat wanes and a spice melange forms with time, lily pads (like… you’d find on a lake… with frogs and such), brie, white pepper, [‘70s era Old Spice after shave]( http://i.imgur.com/YTP1rG4.jpg), peach syrup, pencil shavings, teddy bear fur, and more aloe vera.","Palate:  Barley-forward. Vanilla, white pepper, butter (ghee?), raw sugar (jaggery goor?), slight hint of pear. With time it opens up into a greater mixture of spices, candle wax, the backing on lickable stamps, cotton, lemon pith, and a sort of Fisherman’s Friend taste—eucalyptus I suppose. It’s quite well balanced and put together.","Finish:  Sour and citric, warming, after a while hazelnuts, French praline, cashews, green apple, pear returns—it’s halfway between cloyingly sweet and tart. Very nice. After allowing the whisky to open up for a bit the finish becomes all wax—crayons more than candles, graphite, pencil shavings and lickable stamps. It then gets b-i-t-t-e-r. Very different. I quite like it.","Design:  This is a miniature bottle, but it’s fashioned after the full-sized one. It has a tax stamp over the screwcap, the label features the batch number and date of packaging, and it even came in a protective metal canister. I quite like it. Only downside was the screwcap wouldn’t come loose of the bit that is supposed to stay on the neck of the bottle—I nearly broke the cap trying to remove it. :/","Conclusion:  At first it tasted like single malt whisky aged in an ex-bourbon cask. Not that different from anything else I’ve had, closest perhaps in character to Bruichladdich, although a bit sweeter. After a while, however, it really opened up into a bizarre combination of scents and flavours from my childhood crossed with chemicals and industrial solvents. I don’t know why, but I really dig it. Perhaps because it’s so different. It’s very easy drinking—blind I would never guess it was 46%—and I’m quite looking forward to trying the Cask Strength and Fusion miniatures that I picked up at the same time (as well as a full-sized bottle of something else in the future).",Price:  $11.46 CAD,"Tasted:  A miniature bottle I picked up in Seattle, WA. It has a tax stamp on it (woo) and comes in a miniature canister as well. Due to the ludicrously high ABV, I reviewed this at an adjusted 46% after adding water.

Read on to find out.",Colour:  Amber -2.,"Nose:  Heavy-handed spices, very reminiscent of rye whisky. Cinnamon, white pepper, cardamom, vanilla pod, and an underlying saccharine sweetness. With time the sweetness is identifiable as raw sugar (jaggery goor) crossed with coconut, and there are notes of toasted sesame seeds, grapeseed oil and a hint of smoke and cheese.","Palate:  Warming, spiced, pleasant—this isn’t as hot as the basic Amrut single malt with the added water, even though they’re the same ABV. Burlap notes, rice vinegar, soybean and tapioca come to the fore. With time it opens up into white pepper, dried apricot, pears in syrup, and becomes rather barley forward just like its standard 46% cousin. Notes of toasted walnuts appear, as the spice melange continues to change—leaning more towards oak spice than rye-ish spice.","Finish:  Long, oaky, slightly smoky. Very, very pleasant, but not very complex at first. Opens up into a nice citric note which is simultaneously sour and bitter, but in all the right ways. Ends with soya sauce, tamarind paste and the lingering bite of everlasting oak. With time in the glass the finish transforms completely, becoming very sweet and more like the lickable backs of stamps as found in the standard 46% offering’s palate, but with unsalted pistachios, soybean, toasted sesame and even more puckeringly tannic oak.

Not sure why I was so enamored with them before.","Conclusion:  Well, if you dilute it to 46% ABV it’s similar to the standard release of Amrut Single Malt Whisky—but a much, much better version of it. It’s more balanced, but that could very well be due to this being from a better batch of casks. I’d place this one head and shoulders above the standard Amrut offering, but drinking it at 61.8% is a silly idea.

If nosed immediately after pouring (or from the bottle) there’s a surge of phenols and peat smoke, but after sitting in the glass for a few minutes it recedes and distillery character takes centre stage: Dark chocolate, cinnamon, dark rum, figs, graham crackers, garam masala—cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, specifically. Amrut’s saccharine sweetness has turned treacle, as everything about this whisky is just darker than its brethren. With water it becomes a lovely gently peated dram, plenty of graham crackers, gingerbread, lovely soft pastry notes and peat. ","Palate:  Pickling spice, peat smoke, oak, spice increases but the pickled bit recedes—a cross of oak influence and distillery character with cinnamon, white pepper, soybean and vanilla pod. It’s hot and youthful but it doesn’t go too far. It’s quite tart and has just the right amount of prickliness—especially when paired with the peat. With water it’s much less intense: citrus, barley sugar, gentle peat smoke, oak spice and tannins. Wonderfully sour.","Finish:  Peat smoke, oak, pickle brine, vinegar, soya sauce and a spice melange. After time it progresses into something very tannic and somewhat bitter. Eventually it turns into sweet territory with caramel and pralines surrounded by subtle drawn-out peat smoke.

Such a pain to remove cleanly.","Conclusion:  This offering is quite different from standard Amrut releases, and the distillery character is subsumed by the peated spirit. I like the whisky just fine, but I can’t help but feel that peat didn’t offer any real improvement over the base offering—it’s a bluntly implemented flavour, and doesn’t blend harmoniously with Amrut’s usual characteristics. It noses amazingly, it tastes very nice, the finish is so-so on it, and it absolutely lacks balance. So slight docking of marks for those issues.

Amrut Spectrum,Setup: GNR15M,"Color: [Brown sherry 1.9](http://i.imgur.com/cjuqU69.jpg) Dark as hell, but not quite to the level of the Rye. Impressive.","Nose: Meaty oak. If that doesn’t make sense, think eating dark sausage gravy out of a musky oak bowl. Really quite nice, but at the moment, I’m worried that it’ll have sweet notes that will fight with what’s projecting to be a savory dram. Yeah, on the nose I’d peg this as a well-aged Scotch, possibly with some sherry influence.","Palate: Warm and thick, with the heat building a bit. No problems with the sweet/savory contradiction here, the dram is more nutty oak and dark meat gravy. Surprisingly lacking that signature Amrut flavors, even though I picked up on them right after opening the sample.  ","Finish: Lasting warmth and hints of oak, with a little more peppery spice than was on the palate. ","Thoughts: Wow. This is a damn good dram. Not nearly as fruity as I was expecting based on the other reviews, but very well-rounded and thoroughly enjoyable. I'd love more than a couple ounces to really get into the complexities of the dram. As for the sherry influence, to me it seems very subdued. If I had to guess, it's more Oloroso than PX, and not overwhelming to the point of being the only thing you really notice.",Score: 4.5/5 ,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwhisky/comments/5zo05d/ww_review_33_amrut_spectrum/

Ancient Ancient Age 10 Year,"Nose: Spicy and peppery with a good hint of cherries (or perhaps a bit closer to cherry cough syrup). Very pleasant.

Alcohol immediately makes its presence known, followed by a big burst of peppery spice and a subtler emergence of cherries.

There is also a hint of ashiness that reminds me of JD; perhaps this is one of the few charcoal filtered bourbons?",Taste: Fairly thin with relatively little development. There is an immediate hit of oaky tannin. Big on the sweet and sour notes; caramel comes through more than anything and cinnamon shows up again. ,"Finish: There is a burst of sharp, sour heat, which fades into a lingering sweetness with a tannic backbone.","Conclusion: This was an interesting comparison of two rather differently-styled bourbons. Up until the first little glass of each, I was ready to declare Sample II the winner. However, water killed sample II and really made Sample III shine. From that point on, even revisiting the whiskies sans water, I could only see II’s flaws and III’s strengths. ","Edit: Word from the sender is that they are Ancient Ancient Age 10 Year, and Old Charter 101; both are The Party Source Private Barrel versions. So I guess I was wrong about relative strength (AAA10 is only 86 proof) but I was right about Sample II having more rye in the mashbill. The exciting thing about this mystery review, in addition to allowing me the chance to try two new bourbons, is that it allowed me to compare two bourbons of the same price and from the same distillery (Buffalo Trace), but with two different mashbills.

Ancient Ancient Age 10 Year,Thoughts: This is a really good budget pour. This might be sacrilegious to say but at this price point I probably favor this over Four Roses yellow label.

The vanilla remains intact throughout.  Light citrus notes can be detected as well.  The salt and barley build as you hold it on your palate.","Finish:  A good finish, not overly long but mild and enjoyable.  The sweeter notes fade and give way to the barley and salt.  The result is a finish that is a shade dry and carried with it are tendrils of fresh straw and hay.  The finish does seem to fall a little flat right at the very end.  Perhaps a bump in ABV would remedy this.","Nose: A barley rich nose, that is both sweet and tangy.  Creamy vanilla and feeling of wind swept coastal grass.  A very robust nose with spicy saltiness.  Notes of lemon tea and buscuits.  Similar in style to the 12yr., but amped up a notch or two.","Taste: The salty spiciness present in the nose works its way into the arrival as well.  It then sweetens with barley, citrus and faint vanilla.  More green apple, clove and a faint detection of oak.  Some good quality bourbon casks in effect.","Finish: A slightly shorter finish than the 12 yr. anCnoc, but not unpleasant. Sweet and savory.  The barley and spice dominate.

There's a lot to unpack, and all of it subtle. But it's not so overwhelming that the aromas all blend together.","Taste: Vanilla and butterscotch land first, but they don't pack a punch; the flavor crescendos upon the palate. Then come the white fruits: Pear and apple, coated in honey, gently wash in and absorb the initial notes like the sea engulfing a sand castle. Around the edges, some cinnamon lurks just to spice things up a bit. It's backed by that oak, but they never really come to the forefront--which is just perfect. A supremely done palate. And while there's definitely honey that just holds the pear and apple notes in a gentle embrace, there's also a late-arriving sweetness--it tastes almost exactly like my wife's sugar cookie dough. This makes me happy. Everything about this palate makes me happy.","Finish: For such a restrained whisky, you would expect a rather thin finish, but anCnoc's not done yet. Honey, apple, and cinnamon stick around, letting you know they're there. This whisky certainly isn't chewy, but it's not thin, either. anCnoc has found a wonderful middle ground. Rather than leave in a hurry, it has a decrescendo, mirroring the arrival.","Overall: I've seen this recommended here, and hell, I've recommended this here as a wonderful summer dram. And it is that! Subtle, refined, but still complex--it's the perfect dram to sit out on the deck with, feet up, and just close your eyes, bask in the sunshine, and sip on.

While I like the more hands-off approach to its finishing (no filtration, coloration, etc.) in theory, and I wish more followed this methodology, I think that perhaps it was bottled at a little too strong a proof if they intended this to be drunk as is. It was much improved with some water. That being said, I still prefer the 12 year over the 16. The 16 is very austere and just wasn't that interesting until I  added a significant amount of water. Also, the nail polish remover was a bit of a turnoff for me. Color me...disappointed.

AnCnoc 16,"Nose: Sweet and fruity with elements of barley and whispers of salt.  Luscious vanilla is quite prevalent.  A delicious nose with a lot going on.  I am reminded of cooked green apples glazed with honey and brown sugar.  Buried under all that is a light floral scent.  Faint notes of mild clove and nutmeg round out a nose that is fresh and complex, and quite enticing.","Taste: A slow, calm arrival which makes way to barley infused spices.  The vanilla remains intact throughout.  Light citrus notes can be detected as well.  The salt and barley build as you hold it on your palate.","Finish:  A good finish, not overly long but mild and enjoyable.  The sweeter notes fade and give way to the barley and salt.  The result is a finish that is a shade dry and carried with it are tendrils of fresh straw and hay.  The finish does seem to fall a little flat right at the very end.  Perhaps a bump in ABV would remedy this.","Nose: A barley rich nose, that is both sweet and tangy.  Creamy vanilla and feeling of wind swept coastal grass.  A very robust nose with spicy saltiness.  Notes of lemon tea and buscuits.  Similar in style to the 12yr., but amped up a notch or two.","Taste: The salty spiciness present in the nose works its way into the arrival as well.  It then sweetens with barley, citrus and faint vanilla.  More green apple, clove and a faint detection of oak.  Some good quality bourbon casks in effect.","Finish: A slightly shorter finish than the 12 yr. anCnoc, but not unpleasant. Sweet and savory.  The barley and spice dominate.

AnCnoc Rutter,"Rutter: Non Chill Filtered, Natural Colour, 40% abv, peated at 11.0 ppm, no age listed.","Colour: Light yellow with a faint golden glow, like diluted apple juice.","Nose: The first smell is a floral peat, a subtly different peat than the average Islay whisky.  Smoke and vanilla emerges followed by pineapple, coconut, granny smith apples and further floral notes.  The fruity elements combine for a slightly sour odour, however it's not unpleasant.  Malty notes like cereal and bread are buried deep within the nose amidst faint anise and earthy qualities.","Palate: The smoke and peat dominate at first but are followed by fruitier notes similar to those in the nose that almost exist parallel to the peat and smoke, as if they are dancing on a different part of the tongue.  A Caramel comes out, as do deeper fruit flavours like red apples and raisins.  Somewhere in here I get faint hints of the AnCnoc 12 that I dearly love.  It's hard to guess the age on this, but I'd say it's at least 7 years old.","Finish: Sugar candies, sweet pears, faint leather, and a surprisingly strong alcohol burn for 40%.","Overall: The nose and palate on this are excellent.  This expression is complex, yet somehow incredibly well balanced.  Many of the peated Islays are amongst my favourite whiskies, however they often have a certain bruteness to them even if they are smooth or complex.  The AnCnoc Rutter offers the joys of peat with a uniquely balanced fruity and light quality.  As mentioned, it's almost as if many of the characteristics are running parallel to one another.  They are separate, yet incredibly complimentary of each other.  As with the 12 year old, this is a rewarding whisky for those who like to pick apart the complexities of a good scotch.  The finish left a little bit to be desired, which is interesting considering how much I appreciated the finish on the 12.  I will note that I tried a sample of the AnCnoc Flaughter, another peated offering, and it was very good, however I found the Rutter to be more unique and interesting.",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/29d828/review_60_ancnoc_rutter/

It's like bourbon with a touch of grape soda added, or grape jelly and popcorn. It's pretty light on flavor with not a lot of body and a short finish.

I find it overly light and too rounded which I attribute both to the lowish proof and the port finishing.

There is some bitterness and astringency worth mention, but it is kept well in check. Some citrusy sourness and more cherries.  A young whiskey kick is in there too.  ",Finish:  This has a relatively long and pleasing finish filled with more hazelnut flavors and dark fruit.  Tons of glorious oak show back up in the finish. Sugar cookie dough. I think I’m getting a little sautéed mushroom as well.   I occasionally get a minor off-putting bitterness after swallowing. The sweetness from this lingers on the tongue for a good long while.  ,"Verdict:  This one intrigues me.  If I focus on the nose, it just seems… off.  If I focus on the taste, it also seems off, and doesn’t seem to share much with the nose.  But if I back off a little bit, this just works.  Somehow, in spite of its flaws, this just really seems to come together for me. I think the age of this is perfect for me – it’s got some youthful playfulness, but doesn’t skimp on the rich, full notes from the oak.  I get the impression that this may be a blend from barrels of multiple ages.  This is definitely a dessert whiskey, and I can see how it would not play well with other things.  The port barrel finish plays a very prominent role.  ",Score:  89/100,http://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/2muvre/review_10_angels_envy/cm7spze

Angel's Envy Rye,"Color: Bright and shiny, burnished brass.

Packaging and the Diamond-Shaped Bottle are very nice. The Blend contains 55% Malt whisky and that's a high percentage. All in all 30 whiskies are used for the Antiquary. The heart of the Blend is Speyside, represented by a.o. Glenrothes, Mortlach, Linkwood, Benrinnes and Cragganmore. Other Malts are Tomatin, Clynelish, Royal Lochnagar (Highland), Glenkinchie (Lowland) and Bowmore (Islay). The Grain whiskies are from Port Dundas and Camaronbridge . All whiskies are matured for at least 12 years in American White Oak. It's not cheap at around 45 US Dollars per bottle.",Neat: Good,Conclusion: A very light Blend.

Ardbeg 10,Look: It pours an extremely light straw color; almost the color of Bud Light (as poor as that comparison is).

One smell, and you'll know what's about to hit your taste buds.","Taste: The only thing the smell belies about the flavor is the intensity. That Earthy, mossy, peat that filled your nose before takes over your whole face with the first sip.

However, after having tasted some other fine drams between now and when I first tried Ardbeg 10, there seems to be something missing in this scotch. To me, aside from its heavy footedness towards a couple of flavors, there just seems to be a gap between the initial taste and the finish which I find to leave me wanting more. Maybe that's not a bad thing, but in comparison to some of the scotches that sweep me off my feet and carry me around for a good minute or two, this one just seems to fall short.

Ardbeg 10,"Color: A light honey-lemon colour, this dram could be mistaken for a pale white wine or green tea (only on appearance of course). The bottle and box are both black, everything feels dark about this dram except for its actual liquid appearance.","Nose: I could only pick out toffee around the heavy alcohol smell, so I added a couple of drops of water. After, I can definitely smell the peat like charred sticks as well as lemon zest and a hint of stewed figs. The scent of this dram is intense and lingers wherever you sit the glass down, I would describe this particular scent as a peaty seashell with a hint of dried fruit.","Palate: Pleasantly sweet with a spice that tastes like peppery wood. The peat/smokiness is not as overpowering as you would imagine based on the smell but it brings a sea breeze layer. I had a few bites of dark chocolate muffin and rinsed with water before I refilled the glass, this time without diluting the (second) dram. The spice is more present, as is the smokiness, but I could not identify additional notes.","Finish: Long and heavenly, the sweetness gives way to a sea salt and it makes me think of sea waves because the sensation surges and ebbs very pleasantly. The second dram (not diluted) has a smokier finish that is not as wonderful as the first dram, so I finish that dram by also adding water.","Conclusion: My opinion (and experience after sharing with friends) is that whisky newcomers won’t like this dram, but most Ardbeg expressions will be tough when unfamiliar with the heavy peat and smoke flavour. I love this whisky but I feel it’s a bit expensive to be a repeat purchase, perhaps the price tag leaves me expecting an extra layer of complexity. The finish is very nice though and encourages slower, calmer drinking of this dram. I score it 87 out of 100, and based on the quality of this expression from the initial nosing and tasting I do expect that I will unlock more complexity and notes on subsequent drams of it.","Nose: tobacco, dried stuff (me: “stuff?” her: “tobacco and plums”), “I don’t like the smell of this one”","Palate: “I don’t taste shit, for some reason I think about banana cake” “Smoky plums, like tobacco that is actually plums”",Finish: “Dried prunes that were covered in tobacco and set on fire”,Edit: formatting.,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2mp0ld/review_1_ardbeg_10/

Burnt plastic now. ,Taste: smoke from a bonfire. Real freshness to this smoke. A lightness too but not in a bad way. Smoked and candied lemon rind. White pepper. Peat. Hint of minerality and brine.

Ardbeg 10,"Nose: PEAT. Like a punch in the nose, peat makes its earthy presence known. Right behind that is a strong smell of brine and smoke, like standing on the seashore next to a big bonfire. Saltwater taffy lends a small sweetness, then a light iodine and band-aid smell. Underneath all of that is a very pleasant smell of petrichor. This nose is tremendous; you smell it the second you open the bottle and everyone around you knows that you're drinking something strong. ","Appearance: Very light straw color, and legs that linger for a long time on the side of the glass. There's obviously no added caramel color in this whisky. An uninitiated Scotch drinker might be shocked that such a lightly colored drink could have a smell that fills the entire room.

There's a distinct oakiness, and then a very pleasant combination of dark chocolate, sweet peppers, and honey bring up the rear. After drinking this for awhile and letting it breathe, the chocolate, caramel, and smoke take over. It's kind of like an Islay candy bar. ","Mouthfeel: Watery, and on the thinner side. There's a very potent astringency at first, but I got used to it rather quickly. It makes its presence known, but this isn't a mouth-coating oily scotch.

After a couple seconds, it came back with a very creamy caramel followed by smoke and taffy, then a taste of salty ocean air. Lots of cocoa, like a really dark baker's chocolate.

Ardbeg 10,"Appearance: Amongst the most lightly-coloured whiskies I’ve encountered; indeed, maybe the only lighter whisky currently in my collection is the new sub-4-year-old Canadian single malt from Still Waters distillery. We’re talking pale straw, perhaps pale gold at darkest. Good legs, however. And the Ardbeg branding is just absolutely perfect and classic. It’s a bottle you want to put prominently on display (although the Canadian version, which has to cram in the French translations, looks a bit busy).  ","Nose: Lightly coloured maybe, but holy hell is the nose the opposite of light. I can smell it from across the room. Rich peat smoke is the dominant—even overwhelming—note, but it’s nice. There’s a freshness to it, though, which is kind of a nebulous thing to say. Fresh earth. Cinnamon and clove. Faint sea salt. Barbecue (barbecued pork?). Bacon fat. Leather? Vanilla? Medicinal. Faint citrus? Licorice or anise. Fantastic.","Taste: Surprisingly soft, smooth, and light, actually, and initially quite sweet for me, with a nice tingle and dryness building as it sits on the tongue. You’d expect maybe this to be a bruiser based on the nose, but it’s curiously gentle, albeit in a heavily peated, smoke-filled room kind-of-way. Vanilla and fruity sweetness, then waves of peat, seawater, and burning campfire wood. Iodine. Faint leather. Orchard fruits? Vegetal (boiled leaves?) around the edges. Citrus. Licorice.","Finish: Decently long-lingering peat, smoke, and oak. Faint apples and pears. Heat in the mouth.","Thoughts: I don’t know about Jim Murray’s talk of “perfection on the palate,” but this stuff is absolutely very good, and interestingly a lot more nuanced than I was expecting going in. I’m not sure about that price tag (and the Ontario price, of $100 or so, is just preposterous), but if I found it at that sale price again, I’d definitely grab another bottle.

Very strong “burnt” smell that is unique. I could nose this all day. The nose also has a “fresh” quality that I like. Diluted with 1 tsp of water it becomes big earthy, iodine, medicinal, band-aidy and what I call dusty/musty, but it's also well balanced by sweeter notes of vanilla and caramel which I assume comes from the bourbon casks.

Diluted it is more iodine, very sweetly medicinal and peaty but also some dried fruit which wasn't present before. The burnt character is mostly gone. Again, better neat.","Finish: strong, lingering, warming, spicy, peat/medicinal, smoke, burnt bacon/peat, a tad bitter – finish is similar to the palate but on steroids. The finish is also quite drying. The burnt bacon/peat hangs around for a long time and whets your taste buds for the next sip. Overall, this is basically cigarettes and burnt things in a glass.

Ardbeg 10,Review: Ardbeg 10 and Ardbeg Corryvreckan,Review: #55+56 |  r/bourbon: #7 | r/scotch: #44+45 | r/worldwhisky: #3,Situation: On the sofa trying to catch up with the community review and listening to the Legend soundtrack    ,"Corry: Here the signature citrusy note really shows, cold campfire ash, a little more citrus fruits as well as a little less bitter then the 10, wet seagrass, smoked meat, maybe somewhere there is a pitch black ages old shriveld currant, also less of the sugary note the 10 had    ","Corry:  Wait what? Thick sweet syrupy entry? Nice. Then white pepper hits. Dark chocolate, very dark indeed, Mocca, peat, but close to no smoke before the finish hits you. A little medicinal and no citrus note here. Vanilla. That one currant from the nose is rotting a bit. Very nice but a bit bland taste. The mouthfeel is not as oily I expected after the 10. ","Corry: Uh, here comes the good part! ~~Very well executed~~ Close to perfect cask strength Islay finish! Wow, I didn't expect this after the palate. Dry smoke, chocolate/mocha, white pepper in combination with the sweetness of the palate. Licorice. Smoked but not very spicy meat. By far the best part!   ","Conclusion: On some days I like the Ardbeg 10 better on others a little less. Sometimes I feel like the Ardbeg smoke has a “clean smoke” taste to it, maybe the combination of the “ashy” taste and the abv?, which I can't really explain, but for me that was always significant of the Ardbeg 10. That didn't really show tonight, which is a tad bit strange. All in all I like this a tiny wee bit less then Caol Ila 10, Laphroiag 10 or Talisker 10 which are all very comparable to this dram, even though every one of them has their very own distinctive characteristics. That being said, this is still a very nice dram.    ",Corry: 91/100,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/41033r/review_ardbeg_10_and_ardbeg_corryvreckan/

Ardbeg 10,"Colour: Both the glass it comes in and the glass it came with mask the colour somewhat and so all I really get to see is a marshy green, but as a colour it seems somewhat apt.","Nose: The first half a sniff gives a softness that is suprising for any alcohol above 40% a smokiness is there for sure, it almost smells like history, like it’s something that you remember from childhood but as I go deeper the alcohol overpowers somewhat. However that being said I want to keep smelling it, running it around the glass and opening my nose the smallest amount I am already in love.","Palate: Honestly I think this is a whiskey that gives most of it’s taste on the finish, also my last bottle was an a’bunadh and moving down almost 20% it’s almost tastes like I’ve put  a hint of good mineral water into it, I notice how light it tastes initially in comparison. I normally find as a whiskey moves along my tongue I get hints of other things, and I’ve purposely not looked at any other tasting notes on this in the hope I can find something personal but I can hold it on the front of my tongue almost indefinitely and it just tastes like damn fine whiskey. ","Finish: This is everything I want at the end of a sip of whiskey, there is no lingering alcohol, there can’t be, only the slightest hints of other flavour can pass through the misty smoke that settles in my mouth. Perhaps a hint of zest, but that is struggling to pass through the smoke. It is like someone’s put a lime on the end of a bonfire, waited an hour and then given me a drop of its juice. I feel though with every glass I can get deeper into this, like perhaps there will be a million things waiting for me beyond the smoke. I just have to relax and let them come to me.

Very good balance between Smoke, Ashes and Sweetness. If you don’t like smoky whiskies than better stay away from the Arbeg 10 Y. And most other heavily peated Islays for that matter.

There’s honey in there too alongside further brine and a little breadiness to it. Again this is more complex than the 10 and with plenty more fruit to it.  ","Finish: Long and sweet, the smoke lingers but not overwhelmingly so, by far the strongest lingering taste is the sherry fruits and a twist of pepper.  ","Conclusions: A fantastic combination of sherry and peat, this was a joy to drink.  ","Conclusions: I real loved the Ardberg 10 for it’s simplicity, whilst the Uigeadail I enjoyed for its complexity.

Ardbeg 10,Colour: Amber.,"Nose: Isopropyl alcohol, honey, something vaguely reminiscent of cinnamon.","Taste: Vanilla, apple, harsh alcohol.",Finish: Unidentifiable sweetness alongside toasted grains. Taste dissipates almost instantly.,"Conclusion: I loved it when I first tried it, but after trying a slew of single malts and a higher-end blend, I can understand why it’s mostly used for mixing. I tried some alongside some amaretto (evidently this is called “The Godfather”) and it was pretty good, as far as mixed drinks are concerned.",Colour: Caramel and gold.,"Nose: Isopropyl alcohol, vanilla, toffee.","Taste: Dull caramel (only way to explain it, it’s like unsweetened caramel), vanilla, what tastes to me like corn-derived alcohol, butter.","Finish: Fruity with a hint of peatiness or smoke. Doesn’t fade as quickly as Red Label, more of an alcoholic undertone.","Conclusion: Absolutely loved it in comparison to Red Label, but after trying a handful of single malts and going back to it, I cannae understand why one would choose a blend over a single malt. Rife with grain alcohol, and what I swear tastes similar to corn-derived ethanol.","Colour: Pale Amber, very reminiscent of a hoppier beer, albeit without any carbonation.","Nose: Peat smoke, honey, citrus (not lemon like the bottle claims, more like orange or tangerine?).","Taste: Peat smoke, vanilla.","Finish: A nice and slow finish, with peat/smoke remaining in your mouth for quite some time. I imagine this must be what the remnants of smoking a cigar is like. ","Conclusion: I fell in love with Bowmore 12 as soon as I popped the cork. The smell of it, the taste—when I purchased it I had no idea what a peated whisky was, let alone that it would be so smoky and so wonderful. The first alcohol I’ve ever found myself craving a glass of, and the flavour of it just pops back into my mouth at random.","Colour: Paler than pale, it’s hardly there.","Nose: Maple syrup, sugar cookies or lemon meringue pie (minus the lemon). It smells like a bakery in a bottle. (If a bakery were doused with alcohol first.)",Taste: Reminiscent of a white wine in its oak and light honey… if you can get past the strong alcohol. Also hints of Demerara or raw sugar. ,"Finish: Sweetness, alcohol and sandalwood. And then it’s gone. ","Conclusion: I had a lot of trouble tasting this one, let alone enjoying it at first.  As time goes on (and after subsequent tastings) I’ve found more of the subtleties it has to offer, but I’m still not a fan. Glad I purchased a teeny bottle.",Colour: Golden,"Nose: Oak, moss, a soupçon of smokiness.","Taste: Sweet with a bit of spice, somehow reminds me of a cough drop… but in a good way. There’s some fruit to it, some oceanic and smoky qualities as well—it’s a microcosm of the various tastes of Scotch in a glass.","Finish: The spices that are in the background during the tasting seem to move to the foreground after you’ve drank it. Very long, but ultimately unremarkable.","Conclusion: I likely won’t try it again. It was middle-of-the-road, I enjoyed it, but it didn’t change my life or anything.",Colour: Blonde hair.,Nose: Smoked cheese and brine.,"Taste: A platter of various smoked cheeses, French bread.","Finish: Savoury, lasts quite a while.",Conclusion: This has been my favourite out of all the ones I’ve tasted—very much like drinking a meal; I actually felt comfortably full after drinking this dram.,Colour: The yellow side of amber.,"Nose: Banana, apple, hint of vanilla. ","Taste: Very sweet, the same fruit as the nose, but with underlying maltiness.","Finish: Slow, oak and apples—like bobbing your head into a barrel of apples (if it was filled with whisky rather than water)—it simultaneously lingers, but disappears. Maybe I’m just remembering it longer than I’m actually tasting it.","Conclusion: ‘Twere I to sum this whisky up in a single word, it would be “inoffensive”. I enjoyed it, and it is definitely pleasant. But it doesn’t push any boundaries.",Colour: Dark brown.,Taste: Like someone held a vat of fish over a flaming peat bog. But in a good way.,"Finish: It seemed to disappear from my tongue with surprising swiftness for having such a strong flavour. Left my senses befuddled, and my palate unusable for a while.","Conclusion: I’m not sure I understand the hype behind it—I enjoyed it, sure, but not as much as some of the other offerings I’ve had.

","Taste: Peat, but not punchy peat; the sweetness all but disappears, very earthy, savory, and meaty; Tangy, oaky, and peppery; there are more sensations rather than tastes.

It’s like a good filet, which while not my favorite cut of meat due to its lack of assertiveness, mellow and nice in the mouth with decent, but mild flavor. The only exception is the finish, which is much bolder than one would expect from the flavor. This is one of the few scotches that I like with food, particularly with steak or lamb. It is bright and very drinkable, definitely a go to. In math rather than meat, it’s an exponential growth function.  ",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/175z4f/review_ardbeg_ten/c82i64l

Ardbeg 10,"Nose: The expected odors of peat, iodine, and earth, but equally remarkable are the strong notes of band-aids, sea salt, and surprisingly, rye.  Mostly, exactly what you’d expect from the Froggy 10.","Body: Quite pleasant, but admittedy light relative to the big, brash flavors that its packing, but for a more subtle whisky, the body would be perfectly appropriate.  It definitely doesn’t have the fullness of Ardbeg.","Palate: More of the same medicinal peat from the nose, plus some black pepper, brine, seawater, and smoke.  Islay through and through.","Finish: The sea salt from the nose returns to make for a salt-and-pepper finish, although the peat really does dominate throughout.  There's a reason it gets referred to so frequently as a peatbomb, and that title is well-earned.","Price: Right now…USD $56 at the nearest Total Wine, which is really rather steep, it used to be $45 not too long ago.  Boo.  It also means it's now a few bucks more expensive than the Ardbeg 10, which isn't ideal.","Overall: I love sushi, and I sort of think of Laphroaig (and more broadly, the Islay peated potions in general) as the mackerel of scotch—it’s definitely not for everyone, and its taste is unmistakable, but it has a deservedly devoted following.  Laphroaig 10 is the biggest in that “go big or go home” camp of Islay whiskies, and my inclination when presented with a glass of it is to go big.  85/100","Nose: Much earthier than Laphroaig—Laphroaig really is all about the medicinal notes but Ardbeg seems earthier to me.  Fewer band-aid odors, more salty and mossy smells along with some loamy soil notes.  After letting it sit for a while, a few faint wisps of vanilla extract or birthday cake emerge, adding a surprising—but relatively slight—veneer of sweetness.","Body: Superlatively good—there is definitely more heft and feel to it in this department than Laphroaig, and because of the higher ABV and absence of chill filtering, it is very easy to see why.","Palate: Lots and lots of sea salt and seaweed, but also some seriously oily, savory notes that almost taste like olive oil that has been used to saute a protein like fish or pork, which, along with the oily mouthfeel, might be the best part of the dram—it’s seriously delicious.  Some malt and smoke round things out quite nicely.","Finish: The salt continues to run roughshod over the whole thing, almost to the point of being a detriment.  But after the salt does its thing, the earthy, slightly sweet notes from the nose return and linger a goodly length without much burn, which more than makes up for the overly salty transition.","Price: USD $53 at the same Total Wine outlet, was $45 until recently.  Still good value for the money, though, especially as Islay whiskies go beyond cult status and become increasingly popular, but a 15% price hike still doth sucketh.","Overall: The depth imparted by the oiliness of Ardbeg is what ultimately convinced me of its quality and character, and at least relative to the Laphroaig 10, it just tips the scales in its favor.  I still love Laphroaig and will continuing loving them for as long as they keep cranking out the quality peatbombs, but let this be a lesson: chill filtration makes scotch worse.  86/100",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3tydra/reviews_23_24_laphroaig_10_ardbeg_10/
Ardbeg 10,Colour: Light yellow,Nose: Smoke up front. Something sour that I’ve never experienced before. It might be peat but I’m still too much of a noob to tell. Peat. Brine. Medicinal. The Sea.

After a while something a bit strange like a mangrove. ,Taste: Smoke and Sweetness up front. Wait about 5 seconds then big time Peat and Brine. The sour mangrove smell comes in at the end.,"Finish: Earthy. The smoke and sweetness linger for a while, warming my throat and making the tip of my tongue tingle. Experience tells me I’ll still be tasting this when I’m going to sleep tonight even after brushing my teeth and orally pleasing my wife in whisky fuelled throws of passion.","Conclusion: When I first tried this scotch I immediately decided it was my favourite in place of Highland Park 12 and Talisker 10. I’ve since discovered Laphroaig Quarter Cask which has taken that crown but this is definitely my style of Scotch and Scotch is definitely my style of whisky. After trying this I have bought Caol Ila, Lagavulin 16, Laphroaig 10 and Quarter Cask, and Uigeadail, all because I’m chasing peat. $75 is average for a good young scotch where I come from and I will keep a bottle on hand for regular imbibing. ","Score: 75/100. To clarify I want to use the whole 100/100, not just the top 20, and I need room to grow because as much as I like this and some others I’ve tried, there is better Scotch out there and I will find it.

Ardbeg 10,Cost: $49.00 + tax,Notes: Had just spent the day moving heavy boxes and picking up leaves on a typical brisk fall day.  My 3 year old was running crazy around the house.  The sun was starting to set. I poured my dram into the large wine glass pictured.,Color: Light gold. Chardonnay (see picture). I don’t put much emphasis on color as it can vary based on lighting conditions.  It’s nice to see the variety and illustrate how color plays no part in taste.,Nose: Felt like a slap in the face from a bicycle shop. Rubber from a distance. Once I buried my nose a little further I picked up some more subtle fruit.  Jonathan Apples. Light in flavor as a banana.  Still overwhelming smoke.,Taste: Not very much spice at first.  First words out of my mouth were “That’s a beast!”.  Very smokey but light on the tongue.  Let it sit in various parts of my mouth.  By far tasted the best when I forced it to the sides and underside.  It didn’t leave any burn when left to sit on my tongue.  ,Finish: This was the best part for me.  I’ve been walking around all night with the essence of campfire on my nose and mouth.  You know how after you leave a BBQ and you keep smelling your shirt?  It’s like that. Warmed my belly and caused me to slink a little further in my chair.  My smirk grew just a little.,Overall: If you paid attention to my bio up top you’ll realize this is my first smokey scotch and it was a very pleasurable experience.  I like it more than my previous two scotch’s but for different reasons.  This dram for me puts a nice ribbon on why i’m loving my journey so far - the variety.  I’m on my 3rd glass tonight and I feel like i’m taking a bath in this smoke.,Rating: 84/100,Note:  I tried a taste with a small bit of water and did not care for it one bit.

I feel that compared to some other Islays it is relatively short.  But for that time, it has some fantastic smoke, tar and mild citrus flavors.

Ardbeg 10,Content: 46%,"Region: Islay, Scotland","Nose: Heavy on the peat, lower smoke then I thought there would be but it’s certainly present, brine saltiness with a bit of iodine and pine around the edges.","Taste: Opens up with a nice amount of peat but not as much as I would like (less a kick of peat and more just a showing of it). What it doesn’t deliver in aggressive peat, it more than makes up for in smokiness. As the peat subsides, malt notes are more prevalent and almost dominate the taste by the end (far more so then any other Islay I’ve had thus far). Vanilla oak notes are creeping in towards end of the initial taste, but very subtle.","Finish: The finish is very malty, a bit of peat lingers but not much. The malt character gives it almost a smoky/sweet aftertaste. There is saltiness on the tongue for sure, and the vanilla/oak profile comes through the longer the flavor stays in your mouth. Taste lasts about 2-3 minutes, with a present but only adequate mouth feel. Would have preferred it to be heavier or more oiler, whereas the mouth feel seems to be just more “there” and not heavy in any regard.",Rating: 86/100,"Summary: Overall pretty good, I feel it would benefit from weighing towards either more complex or more intense to really win me over. Laphroaig does it better IMO by being more intense and really concentrating on the peat character. There is good craftsmanship here, but not the profile or emphasis I want/like. I guess I just don’t appreciate the pure smoked malt character this pushes as its main element, if there was more intense peat, more complex flavors, or more sweet notes, I would have given it a higher score.",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2gkpe4/reviews_1418_talisker_glenfarclas_lagavulin_more/

Ardbeg 10,"Color: Incredibly light - I was shocked at the lightness of the hue in my glass. I always assumed Islay's would be darker, but I'm noticing that hypothesis is less and less correct with every dram. It looks like a light chardonnay, almost like Glenmorangie's Nectar D'Or. Very pleasant and deceptive for what lies ahead in the glass.  ","Nose: Yep, there it is. Big smoke. Less refined than the Corry but still very smokey and peaty, I believe. It's less overwhelming but also more smokey than peaty. I'm getting a good amount of char, maybe even a little mud. It reminds me of a good ATV ride in the backwoods - this would be an excellent camping dram. After, there's a tiny bit of vanilla and sweetness, but not enough to convince you this sucker might be sweet on the tongue.","Taste: There's a ton of smoke here. Burnt marshmallow, maybe? I like it, and there's definitely an array of flavors but they're all hidden behind the smoke. There's a little peat as well. I'm picking up some muted astringent plastic notes? There's some more smoke, actually there's just a lot of smoke. I wish I could pull more out of this but this one is proving difficult for me.    ","Finish: The finish is really quite long. It's warm, and there's more alcohol burn/tingle as opposed to the Corry but it's not overpowered or punishing in the least. This is where I notice the smoke most - I felt like I had been standing next to a bonfire for quite sometime after I finished this dram. There's a little more plastic but not enough to be distasteful.  ","Overall: Peat and smoke are interesting. I don't fully understand them and I'm not sure I fully love them yet. I can appreciate the depth and complexity that goes into ths dram, but I'm still not sure I'd go to a bar and pick one of these over a more familiar dram. It's exciting though, I'm still overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of new flavors and notes and I look forward to forging ahead to my next Ardberg dram tomorrow evening!",Rating: 83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/40vz0d/review_4_ardberg_10/

A medicinal peat is interlaced with it, along with a weak lemon-like citrus zest that follows the rest on the tail.

Sure I get some of the common elements of the distillery, like the peat smell is relatively similar to the Uigeadail, but the overall flavor profile is very different. This seems to go for a much lighter, more refreshing approach, while the Uigeadail went for an explosion of different flavors at all once in your mouth. This also reminds me of Laphroaig with its grassy and herbal notes, but again much lighter and not as ""decomposed"" tasting. I thoroughly enjoyed the more straight forward, slightly briney, and overall more refreshing characteristic of this dram though.

One is that, despite being 46% ABV, this whisky has very little heat or alcohol burn; there is massive flavor here but it's easy to drink.  The second big impression for me, beyond the peat, is how Ardbeg 10 has has those mild fruity and citrusy notes that are secondary to the peat, but which nonetheless are complementary and help make this more than a one-dimensional peat monster.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/83fvaq/review_4_ardbeg_10/

A-/B+ ","Taste: Super mellowed, lots of oak but not aggressive or tannic. More washed out like an old boat dock. Some lemon and cocoa. Several drops of water help this, tone down the wood and bring up some BBQ notes. Nice but ultimately lacking some punch. B","Finish: Ashy marmalade licked off a chopstick, white pepper. A-","Up: Well, that was interesting. The previous oldest Ardbeg I have had was Airigh Nam Beist (~16 years), which I enjoyed but found lacking the oomph of the younger, tarry Ardbeg offerings. This dram, by comparison, is wonderfully aromatic and deliciously lingering. Unfortunately, in the middle the sipping is just ok. Great fun for a sample or if you’re out at a fancy whisky bar, can’t imagine buying a whole bottle for the amount it’d cost. Still, overall maybe my favorite 20+ year old whisky I have had, which is generally not my favorite genre. A lot of good Islay single malt at 18 years, past that the gentle barley spirit just can’t keep up with my desire for smoky ashen ruin. So I dunno, I guess overall it’s a B+ as the nose is really good and the finish is outstanding.

Ardbeg Airigh Nam Beist 1990,Nose:  Upon first nosing a blast of pure peat is present.  What is odd is that this is not the citrus-y peat you find in the 10 year but rather a more pure peat.  What I find odd about the Beist is that the more I nose the less peat I smell.  The smell turns into sweet warming vanilla-oak-grass mélange with the most obvious and powerful smell being fruit.  Very pleasing.,Palate: Salted pine nuts that envelops the mouth with a velvety soft but oily consistency.  The scotch then turns into a meaty malt then pleases the tongue.  The palate is actually quite sweet for an Ardbeg.  Underneath it all a warm peat is present that does not overpower the flavors like the 10 yr tends to do.,Finish:  Sadly short.  Well balanced oak sticks around along with the warm peat for a while but not long enough.,Overall:  Versus any other expression of Ardbeg the Beist cannot compete however this is not a bad thing.  It is a lovely scotch that gives you a good time.  It is much sweeter than most Ardbegs and because of that I would recommend this for someone looking to get into Islays coming from a pedigree of highlands and speysides.,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/irvne/review_ardbeg_airigh_nam_beist_a_sweet_beist/
Ardbeg Airigh Nam Beist 1990,"Beist: 1990 (2008 bottling); 46% ABV; Aged 18 years. $24 for a two-ounce pour at [Jack Rose](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-M1LKT4QySqE/UVA1lUv4vpI/AAAAAAABa6A/wd6If8BtfZo/w918-h612-no/JackRoseInteriorPhoto.jpg) in Washington, DC. ","Mood: Crowded, but not packed that night. Had a seat at the bar. Unfortunately, I was down at the bar and somewhat annoyed because my colleague managed to get us kicked out of the open bar event upstairs (Scotch wasn't on the open bar, though, so at least there was that). Still, the music was bouncing between Phoenix, Ella Fitzgerald, and everywhere in between, so how many complaints could I really have?","Visuals: Pale, golden caramel. Thin legs stuck to the walls of the glass, but wide swaths of visual shimmer were left everywhere the whisky touched.","Nose: Medicinal—more so than is normal, even for an Ardbeg. Smoke, but not really ""smokey,"" and it fades with each additional sniff. Iodine. Warm. Burnt sugar. Hints of caramel and vanilla.","Feel: Not quite creamy or oily. Think ""hot tea with a splash of cream.""","Taste: Smoke. Ash. Hints of vanilla, spice, and fruit. I'm convinced there's caramel in here, but I can't ever quite seem to find it. Warm, but not close to having an actual burn. Also, let's be honest, there's more smoke.",Finish: Shorter than one might have hoped. Smoke. Tobacco ash.

Ardbeg Alligator,"Context: I was once again dramming in the dimly-lit rockin' environment of Chicago's Delilah's. I didn't get color notes this time (sorry) and I have no prices either, but I can tell you both 1oz pours were a wee bit costly. My opinion of this distillery keeps on rising, so let's dive in!

","Finish: Peat, char, coal, salt, pine, Chloroseptic, and more tar.  ","Conclusions: Tart, puckering, and mouth-numbing. Dare I nickname this Ardbeg Double Black? No, I won't. A bit too medicinal and bit like licking your scotch off a hot road. But quite a powerful experience. 83/100  ","Intro: Ardbeg Supernova is peated to 100PPM, which makes it (by that measure) the peatiest scotch I've tried. Also, it is cask strength at 58.9%.

","Finish: Would you believe it if I said ""peat?"" Ash, lemon, lime, wharf water, wormwood, and vodka.  ","Conclusions: Tough to score. A little too much peat and a little too little malt.

Ardbeg Ardbog,Region: Islay.,"Color:  Dark brown, very dark IMO for a no color added whisky	","Nose: I pick up some heavy earthy and medicinal notes right away with some salt.  Lots of peat, hard to pick through for me.  A much heavier smell than the Uigeadail and not as sweet.  With water honey became immediately obvious.  Also rounded out some of the medicinal notes.","Taste: Sweeter than I expected at first, followed by a lot of smoke, a very thick sort of smoke too, more so than the other Ardbegs I've tried.  Char.  I actually find this really challenging to get through, and I really like peat/Ardbeg.  Not in a bad way, just in an overwhelming way.  It's really thick and a bit oily.  Water improved it quite a bit for me, make it less overwhelming, but it's still a little too ash-y and charred for me.  Some hints of sweetness overwhelmed by the peat.","Finish: Honestly to me it's still just hard to get through, a reasonably long finish, but it's the bad parts of eating something burnt that linger.","Score: 81, B-.  I never thought I would say this, but I think this is too much for me, and I typically enjoy a kick in the teeth.  I don't think water made it a lot better, and I think it was too imbalanced.  Water brought out more, but it's still imbalanced.  It's not awful, it's just not something I could personally sit down and enjoy.

Ardbeg Ardbog,"Introducing: Ardbog! Yes, scratch the “e” and swap it with an “o”.","Excerpt: “Ardbog is matured for ten years in traditional American oak ex-bourbon barrels and rare ex-Spanish Manzanilla sherry butts. This gives Ardbog a distinctively salty texture accentuating the salty, briny flavours already prevalent in the whisky.”","Nose: Salted & baked orange rinds soaked in sour cherry juice, smoky (yeah) but mild on the nose, mocha richness, vanilla stability and old school Lionel Train anarchy (like my old train set back in the day, you might remember the oily, smoky, saltiness that they put off?). ",Color: Deep gold and a rich copper mix,"Palate: The briney and sherry flavors of Ardbeg's popular Uigeadail are the first impression I take from this expression. At first, it is almost like this is Oogie. It is salty, sweet, complex and deep. Orange fades to the back, but the toffe and mocha jump to the front of the palate. The slight dip in ABV is actually apparent. There is no burn, this is a smoother version of the Oogie. It also has a creamy texture I find enjoyable in the Corryvrecken. ","Finish: (BTW, on to dram #2 :/) Smooth. Much smother than Uigeadail, more like the 10 or Corryvrecken in its mildness. It lingers, the peat hangs in there nicely, and the sherry/vanilla/sweetness is prevelent as well. Chewy, tasty and fairly long. ","Nose: Becomes even more subtle, the oranges are less salted, but brineyness remains. More vanilla and mocha/espresso aroma comes through. You smell the sweetness. ",Color: Dark gold,"Palate: If you ever thought to yourself that Uigeadail needed to be toned down, this is the way to play it. So smooth, creamy, deep and peaty with sherry/caramel accompanyments.

It is interesting as hell! I need to spend more time with this one to allow it to grow on me. While it has nice flavors and creamyness, it is extremely familiar. Oogie and Corry for me, as a devout Ardbeg freakboy, are better but not terribly different. Worth a try in dram form should it become available in your area, but your bottle purchase decision should follow from your own impression of a smaller taste.

Ardbeg Auriverdes,"Tasted: At the Ardbeg Day 2014 event in Vancouver, BC.  ",Colour: Amber +1/2 (hard to tell with lighting at event)  ,"Nose: Classic Ardbeg peat profile, lemon zest, lime rind, grassy note and more citrus. Smoke with an underlay of fresh berries, almost a blueberry note. Some cinnamon or allspice, white grapes, light brine and coastal aspect, almost reminiscent of fish… but not quite there. Another complex spice melange emerges, very light tinge of something that reminds me of Laphroaig more than Ardbeg, but it’s quickly replaced by shortbread, vanilla cake and coffee cake. Harsh ethanol and light vegetation, mostly seaweed. Letting it open up for 5-10 minutes reveals honey and stronger blueberry notes.  ","Palate: Grass, mud, peat—but of a lighter than usual sort for Ardbeg. Salty oceanic water, light tartness and bitter sweetness in the background. Smoked white sugar, blueberries and sugar-laden blueberry jam or marmalade. Sweet sandy note, with lavender or violet note hiding somewhere in the mid-palate, alongside the blueberry notes. Cheap perfume arises, soapy violet, spicy florals, bitter orange, and suddenly pure violet, like a violet liqueur. Stone, like gravel on the breeze getting in your mouth.  ","Finish: Long. Cloying sweetness, fresh vegetal peat, brandy notes, hard toffee candies (like Werther’s Original), something almost like weak iced coffee, but not the mocha notes claimed on the bottle or in advertisements. Dry, sour fruit, iodine and antiseptic cleaner. After 5-10 minutes, floral and blueberry notes dominate the finish, with a remarkable gravely/stone-like quality in the mid-palate. It’s very much like a stone surrounded with fruit jam and flowers. Quite lovely, quite different.  ",Design: An enormous golden behemoth of a bottle—colour me jealous.,"Conclusion: If you don’t allow it time to open up in the glass, it’s a younger version of Ardbeg Ten. Fiery, hot, somewhat unpleasant even. But after 5-10 minutes (erring on the side of more time rather than less) I found lovely notes of smoked violets, smoked blueberry jam, and an interesting gravely/stony quality. Tastes at first of the ocean or shoreline, then tastes to me like the Okanagan Valley. (A local area where tonnes of fruit is grown, and tonnes of wineries and vineyards are located. Renowned for its fruit.) I would definitely like a bottle of this in my collection. That said, around these parts a bottle would run me $150 CAD, which is more than what Ardbog was last year, and seems a bit much for such a young whisky.

Ardbeg Blasda,"Nose: Soft and Sweet- The first thing I notice is the peat even though it's phenol content is only 8 ppm. However, the subdued smoke allows for a better grasp on the floral notes so characteristic of Ardbeg. Woods notes immediately pop out to greet me and it's nice not having to search for it. At 40% ABV the alcohol on the nose is almost non-existent. There are some citrus notes but it's more woody, almost like the smell of the phloem or cambium layer of a orange tree.","Palate: Light and Tasty- Again, the lack of heavy peat really accentuates the floral notes. Slightly oily mouth feel reminds me that this isn't just a watered down version of the Ardy 10. Citrus fruit notes are more prominent in the taste with ginger and sea salt; almost like a margarita. There is no sign of immaturity here but I could just be inexperienced at picking it out. ","Finish: Delicate and Delicious- Tons of vanilla on the back end with a nice briny, saltwater taffy taste.

I'm glad I didn't end up with a full bottle of this, and hope that Ardbeg tweaks it in the future to be more than just a novelty.",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1ls11e/ardbeg_blasda_review/

Ardbeg Corryvreckan,Color: A beautiful gold,"Nose:  It is an Ardbeg that is quite refreshing.  Like every other Ardbeg, Corryvreckan's essence has a smoldering phenolic intensity.  What makes Corryvreckan different is that in conjunction with that burning a refreshingly sweet scent of passion fruit makes its presence known.  Oranges and lemons more specifically.  A hint of warm butter also hits the nose quite early on in the nosing.  ",Palate:  Luxuriously awesome.  This whisky hits your mouth with an initial intensely strong vanilla that transforms in a slowly gradual almost deliberate way into the citrus fruit the nose hints at.  I cannot express the uniqueness of this transformation; the flavor evolves like nothing I have ever experienced.  Other than for the initial blast of sweet flavor the phenolic madness of Ardbeg is ever present.  The consistency is also important to note because of how thoroughly this scotch coats the mouth in thick viscous smokeyness.,Finish:  It is in the finish that it becomes clear why Ardbeg named this expression after the world's second largest whirlpool.  The finish is like drinking fire in a way that makes you want to down a container of napalm and swallow a match.  I found myself tasting smokey peppered jerky for tens of minutes after.  The whisky also leaves your mouth so dry that you find yourself watering in an AWESOME way.,Overall:  Addictive.  I love Ardbeg and this expression does not disappoint!  It is rather pricey for what it is at $68 dollars a bottle but for a special occasion Corryvreckan is a must for any Islay fan.,Edit: I just discovered this pretty awesome promo Ardbeg has for Corryvreckan,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ihyg3/review_ardbeg_corryvreckan/
Ardbeg Corryvreckan,Misc: The color of apple juice.  Medium legs.  Cool dry mouthfeel.,"Nose: Refined, not as much ethanol as you'd think given the proof.  Brine, peat, white wine, pine, cedar, black pepper, licorice, leather.  After it opens up awhile, some surprising tropical fruit notes: banana and papaya or possibly mango.  Water brings out the Ardbeg lemon zest and enhances the brine.","Palate: Very delicate and light on the intake with some wood.  Peat quickly takes hold with a surprising sweetness, the licorice is really prominent here.  Black pepper, brine, purple jujyfruits candy.  Water adds / enhances glazed & smoked meat and tobacco.","Finish: Aha!  There's that alcohol burn that the nose and palate were hiding.  Medium length, peaty with some oak and toffee at the end.  Water adds that purple jujyfruit note and adds salt to the toffee.","Notes: I got the water just right this time, about a half inch in a drinking straw did the trick.",Overall: 87/100,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2t8ry2/review_3_ardbeg_corryvreckan/
Ardbeg Corryvreckan,"Nose: Peat smoke, fresh granny smith apples, buttery vanilla, salty olives, black liquorice. Some defined wood notes, but more like a woodshop rather than an oak barrel.

Hints of oak and spiced fruits. Notably malty.,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/141u6a/review_ardbeg_corryvreckan/c793q5z

",Finish: phenolic note and milk chocolate longer in my mouth for what feels like forever. ,Overall: this is a fantastic expression and probably my favorite of the ardbeg core line. This does it for me more that the uigeadail. I prefer the dry tar spice that the corryvreckan brings. Really warms my gullet just right. No complaints about this malt.

","Conclusion: On some days I like the Ardbeg 10 better on others a little less. Sometimes I feel like the Ardbeg smoke has a “clean smoke” taste to it, maybe the combination of the “ashy” taste and the abv?, which I can't really explain, but for me that was always significant of the Ardbeg 10. That didn't really show tonight, which is a tad bit strange. All in all I like this a tiny wee bit less then Caol Ila 10, Laphroiag 10 or Talisker 10 which are all very comparable to this dram, even though every one of them has their very own distinctive characteristics. That being said, this is still a very nice dram.    ",Corry: 91/100,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/41033r/review_ardbeg_10_and_ardbeg_corryvreckan/

Ardbeg Corryvreckan,Colour: Dark Gold,Body: Full,"Nose: Smoky bacon, BBQ, ash, soot, a little medicinal, burnt brown sugar, more sweet sticky BBQ, sweet meaty sulphur, lime jelly baby, juicy orange.","Water: Bigger sherry, big orange and lime juiciness, marzipan, cinnamon, jelly babies, some sour lime too, ash, charcoal. More dark and earthy after a bit- Leather, coffee and dark chocolate. Also sticky toffee pudding, maple syrup and caramel. Fresh and juicy while still dense and earthy.","Taste: Big intensely sweet arrival on brown sugar, dirty orange and lime citrus, quite juicy smoke coming up, campfire, peat smoke, creamy oil, oily malt, then the citrus and smoke intermingle more with some sweet BBQ and a juicy burst into the finish.

Sweet and earthy with malt, kiln, sherry and a little spice.","Water: Drier with sour lime and coffee, some salt coming through.","Notes: 12/2014 batch. 10% older sherry casks, can't be too old at the moment though.

The oak kicks in after a few seconds with lots of spice- Ginger, nutmeg and white pepper with fresh oak.",Finish: Long length. Light peat smoke fades with spice staying- Oaky tannins and lime citrus.,Notes: Finished in virgin Limousine French oak casks. Not as complex as the Oog. ,Colour: Gold,Body: Medium,"Nose: Wonderful. Very tropical, juicy and fresh. Old Laphroaig-esque complex fruitiness, juicy pineapple and mango combo, banana, cinnamon buns, creamy smoke in the background, oily lime. A really beautiful nose, very much reminiscent of Laphroaig 25 for me.","Water: A lovely fresh orange note comes out with more lime citrus, it's lost the smoke though.","Taste: Gentle arrival. Wonderful sweetness, a little oily malt, banana, a little of that mango and pineapple, then smoke building (yes!), oily lime, Ardbegian peat, smouldering kiln, peaty malt. Islay all over it. The strength is just enough to keep it afloat.","Water: Fresh and gentle. Orange, a little waxy, then then oiliness really kicks up with a lot more spice. Loses the mouthfeel a little.","Finish: Medium/Long length. Back to tropical, some smokiness lingering with oily malt and a touch of spice.","Water: Longer and more spicy, but less balanced.","Notes: Distilled March 1996, bottled 2015. 19yo from 2 Bourbon Barrels.

Bandages, cough syrup, sticking plasters, a little TCP, creamy and oily, peat embers. There's some fruitiness underneath it all- Bandages soaked in lime juice (yes, really), a little pineapple. The oak is also very much present with some spice- Cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger.","Water: Much more fruit and spice coming out. Mango, pineapple, lemon and lime, much more oak, tannins, more ginger.","Taste: Intense, hugely big, very medicinal and peaty but there's also fruit and sweetness. The fruit and the oaky smoke and fighting it out and neither can quite best the other, salt, intense lemon, lemon peel, bandages, TCP, plasters, peat embers, kiln, very oily and full.

Very oaky into the finish.",Finish: Long/Very long length. Still intense and mouth coating. It's not leaving without a fight. Lemon and a little lime citrus and medicinal peat lingers and lingers.,Water: More tingling oak tannins.,"Notes: Distilled 1993, bottled July 2013. 19yo from a Bourbon Hogshead. Laphroaig were the owners at the time, distilling just once a week. A great whisky, unfortunately a little overly oaky. Better without water I'd say.",Colour: Gold,Body: Full,"Nose: A perfect balance of the last 2! Perfect. Medicinal, peaty, fruity and a little oak. Cinnamon hit, mango and pineapple COMBO! X2! Lemon and lime COMBO! X3 Bandages and plasters COMBO! X4! The peat is there, attached to the lime- A little like the 1993. Sucking lime juice through bandages but this time covered in soot. Also oranges, some tar and quite a bit of waxiness with paraffin and camphor.","Water: Wonderfully complex, integrated and balanced. The flavours don't really change much but notes are highlighted without detracting from any of the others. A little of the sea and less oak.","Taste: Intense, rich and sweet. Wonderfully fruity, very citrus lead with lime, lime juice, lemon peel, grapefruit, a little sour wood, a little chocolate and oak, quite salty too, peat smoke is there, seamless in the background but comes out more going into the finish with chocolate and mocha. Strength is perfect, great mouthfeel.","Water: Lemon juice, salt sea water, intense juicy mango, oily pepper, medicinal lime, more sea water then oak kicks in going into the finish.",Finish: Long length. Lovely lime citrus and peat embers firing up then guttering with soot. A little chocolate and mocha.,"Notes: Distilled Feb 1991, bottled Jan 2014. 23yo from a Bourbon cask.

Ardbeg Corryvreckan,Proof: 46% abv.,"Color: Golden straw, quite light.","Nose: You know what you are in for right out of the gate with a hearty, smoky nose that enshrouds a citrusy sea breeze.","Palate: Thick and oily, starts with a nice malty sweetness with citrus and green apple. These flavors are quickly bowled over by the peat.","Finish: The finish is exceptionally long, and the peat smoke sticks in your mouth for a long, long time.

Ardbeg Corryvreckan,Distillery: Ardbeg,Expression: An Oa,Color: [.6](https://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg),Nose: Funk. Light campfire smoke. Plums. Toasted grains. Loam. Dairy-scent. Potpourri. (20/25) ,Palate: Classic Ardbeg ashy peat presence immediately but much softer than the 10 year. Rolls in rather than punches. Pineapple. Ginger spice. Muted/soft dark fruits (Sherry influence). (18/25),Finish: Medium. The soft peat and muted dark fruits just kind of fall away leaving a spicy oiliness on the tongue. (16/25),Impression: This is certainly a disappointing release from Ardbeg. I would imagine that it's the equivalent of Laphroaig Select. It is certainly a soft experience and while it contains the classic Ardbeg ashy peat and mouthfeel it fails to do anything other than remind me how much better the 10 y/o is.

Light homemade caramel sauce. Dried apricots. Raisins Herbs (much like the Nikka FTB). Custard. (20/25),Finish: Medium. Herbs and custard mingle on the tongue forgetting that smokey peat was ever part of the Ardbeg profile. (19/25) ,Impression: Wow. This was not what I was expecting. It is darker than I expected and abandons what I consider to be Ardbeg's signature ashiness. Overall it's a pleasant dram. I'm surprised by it in a good way.

Ardbeg Corryvreckan,Color: Fairly Light golden amber ,"Nose: Smoke from a peat fire in a pub, lemongrass, sea spray, buttered toast.  Only a hint of band aid. Minimal ethanol, which is surprising at this proof. ","Finish: Fairly long. Quite warming. Smoky and lightly medicinal peat swirls around throughout. I notice a little oak here, and a slight bitterness. ","Conclusion: A year ago, I don’t think I would have liked this. My tolerance for medicinal peat phenols has increased. I did always like the smoky, or vegetal elements. This is good. It’s quite a powerful dram, with very bold flavors and alcohol strength. While I like it, I probably wouldn’t seek it out.  I prefer a little more balance of other flavors.  It’s still quite solid and I’ll give it a B at 86.  Peatheads would of course score it higher.

Ardbeg Corryvreckan,"Color: For the darkness of the bottle and the intensity of the smell coming from this little tiny bottle, it's surprisingly light. Looks to be a lot like artificial caramel, or that of a light copper.  ","Nose: Like a tsunami. I'm getting what I think is peat and smoke, and a shitload of it. It smells salty, like the ocean with some medicinal bandage mixed in, although I noticed the iodine notes really diminish after about 15 minutes or so in the Glencairn. There's no ethanol, which surprises me for a higher proof. I'm getting some plasticy notes, I think, but I still can't really put my finger, er, nose on it. A few more whiffs yield to some light citrus, maybe orange or lemon? There's also a little vanilla as well. It's growing on me, as time goes by. I don't hate it, it's just a shocking difference from my favored sherry bombs. So much more complex as well. ","Taste: Okay here goes. It's incredibly gentle, there's no hint of alcohol whatsoever. I'm shocked by how complex and pleasant the mouthfeel is compared to the nose. There's no bandages or iodine, just smoke. And warmth, I'm not sure how to explain it but contrasted to bourbon, this dram warms my mouth. Maybe this is the result of how thick and pleasantly oily it is, but I know that I like it. There's more plastic, some more brine - this strikes me a more forgiving than a dram of Talisker Storm I had some time ago. There's a tiny amount of vanilla, but not as much as the nose. This is going to take some serious time to really acquire a taste for, but based on my first impressions of the nose, I like it far more than I expected. tl;dr: Thick, oily, salty and peaty but sweet and very well blended.      ","Finish: The finish is long and once again, very smooth. No burn at all, and no real unpleasantness. There's just a lot of salt and seabreeze with a little citrus and sweet. I'm a fan.   ","Overall: I honestly didn't know what to expect from this as it's really my first deep dive into peat - but I liked what I tried. I wouldn't say I'm a fanatic just yet, but I can appreciate it and am excited to try more. Which is good, because I have 9 more notoriously peaty drams to try thanks to some awesome swaps, mostly Laphroaigs, Lagavulins and another couple Ardbergs. It'll be a bumpy but fun ride.

Ardbeg Dark Cove,Distillery: Ardbeg,Expression: An Oa,Color: [.6](https://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg),Nose: Funk. Light campfire smoke. Plums. Toasted grains. Loam. Dairy-scent. Potpourri. (20/25) ,Palate: Classic Ardbeg ashy peat presence immediately but much softer than the 10 year. Rolls in rather than punches. Pineapple. Ginger spice. Muted/soft dark fruits (Sherry influence). (18/25),Finish: Medium. The soft peat and muted dark fruits just kind of fall away leaving a spicy oiliness on the tongue. (16/25),Impression: This is certainly a disappointing release from Ardbeg. I would imagine that it's the equivalent of Laphroaig Select. It is certainly a soft experience and while it contains the classic Ardbeg ashy peat and mouthfeel it fails to do anything other than remind me how much better the 10 y/o is.

Ardbeg Dark Cove Commitee Release,Review: Ardbeg Dark Cove (Committee Release 55%)    ,Edit: this is actually Scotchreview 77 forgot the PC community review...,Review: #104 | r/bourbon: #17 | r/scotch: #77 | r/worldwhisky: #10 | Ø 85,Situation: Having had it yesterday and now finishing my sample from /u/buddy_dosser (Thanks again for a nice swap and the nice samples!) and tipping my notes for this one as well as some other older reviews on my desk. The office TV shows Superbowl XXXVIII while I wonder if /u/I_SAID_NO_GOLDFISH took his dog for a walk...     ,"Nose: Pretty ardbeggy, so ashy, citrus, malt, dark earthy notes (think wet black sand) as well as some - sorry - dark fruits. Also, some other darkish notes like chocolate and coffee, yes both dark of course!, as well as Bourbonish caramel notes. Which isn't dark unless it's dark hohohoho...ok I'll see myself out then...    ","Taste: sweet and creamy entry, then black pepper, salty seaweed (well, like I imagine it would taste...), prominent Sherry influence (almost like PX though it probably is Oloroso...) ashy smoke, and then, all of a sudden, a very nice     ","Finish: hard candy-like cloying sweet underneath, brine-y above, spicy and long, smoke lingers above it, darrrrk espresso and darrrrk chocolate, noticeable wood influence at the end! Do we have hints of the age? Guessing mainly in the around 5 year range (as there is some young roughness in this one) plus some noticeably older casks? Then again there's some young roughness in there as well, Argh fuck it, nice mix anyway. And really good!      ","Conclusion: I would say a bit sweeter then Oog, I should have them SBS...for science of course! Though I'm missing the sugar coated bacon notes...very solid release, kicking the Lore into dust and raising my hopes for the Laga 8.

Ardbeg Dark Cove Committee Release,"Nose: Rose, fig, raisin, gunpowder, cigar, permanent marker, banana","Taste: Sweet! PX sherry, bright and sparkly. Rather hot, tastes every bit the 55%. Cinnamon, red hots, cocoa powder, smoke of course but very muted in comparison to the sweet and spicy flavors.","Finish: Long, malty, turning bitter and vegetal with time.","Uigeadail: It's honestly hard to say which one is ""better."" Similar quality, but different. Dark Cove is definitely sweeter and has that funky sherry bomb thing going for it, while retaining that quintessential Ardbeg character. Uigeadail is more beastly and smoky. Gun to my head, I give the edge to Dark Cove. The first time I tried Uigeadail (while I'm no longer as impressed with it as I once was), the peat and sherry combo was a revelation, and Dark Cove is a pleasant reminder of that experience with the sherry factor cranked up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4qud5a/review_56_ardbeg_dark_cove_committeeonly_edition/

Sea spray, brine, smoldering wood ash, sweet sherry, earthy, chocolate, slight black pepper spice. Medium to full mouthfeel.  ","Finish: Bring lingers, sherry starts to fade as a light malt comes up, earthy take over the ashy and holds to the end. Long length.

Ardbeg Dark Cove Committee Release,Status: Ask /u/toadpooh (and thanks for the samples!!!),Color: Light cedar-ish,"Nose: Very light and mild, with only a hint of sour grapes at first. Some sweet malt comes through after a few minutes, but no peat shows up that I can find. Perhaps this is due to how long the bottle has been opened, as I recall Laga 16 having more character in the past, but the nose is not very characteristic of a sherried Islay like I’d expect. I haven’t tried Balvenie Peated Cask (or whatever), but this is kinda what I’d expect from it. ","Palate: Soft, warm, and easy to drink. Sweet, slightly smoky, but not much Sherry coming through at all. On the last pass, some bitterness comes out - a note I recall from my first tasting of this sample earlier this week. ","Finish: Same as the palate – the mild warmth and sweetness linger along with the smoke, thought the smoke does become more prominent here. Luckily the bitter note fades quickly, but it still turns me off a touch.","Score: B- (C = ok, B = nice to have, A = must have)","Notes: Perfectly serviceable, and probably still a good deal at $60 (where you can find it that cheap), but it’s no longer my benchmark dram like it was a year or two ago. Considering the Oogie is usually priced the same, I’d grab the Oogie any day, except if I was introducing an Islay newbie.",Status: Freshly opened (~1 hour),Color: Light pine – the lightest of the bunch,"Nose: Kinda tequila/mescal-ish – gets those salivary glands going in the back of your throat. Mild peat, with a touch of golden flame raisins. ","Palate: Warm and full-bodied. Sweet and smoky, while still being light and fruity. Not much depth on the palate or the nose, but it’s still very enjoyable. Maybe not $65 enjoyable, but not bad at all.","Finish: Warmth and smoke last a second, with the sweetness fading quickly. Same here – not much new going on, but still enjoyable.","Score: B (C = ok, B = nice to have, A = must have)","Notes: While the Laga 16 would be a better intro dram to somebody just starting to venture out of the Speyside region, I would recommend the Laga 8 for those better acquainted with Islay. It’s not complicated, but the youth and vibrancy play well with the character of the spirit and make this a more interesting dram overall. That said, the Laga 16 I recall from days of yore would knock the socks of both of these.","Status: Ask /u/toadpooh, but I’m sure it’s a relatively newly opened bottle.",Color: Dark pine/light oak – only darker than Laga 8,"Nose: Not your usual Laphraoig iodine, but instead a more subdued and well-rounded peat. Still a bit medicinal, but with a touch of very ripe watermelon and wood-fired yams. The Band-Aid note comes out after a minute, unfortunately, setting this one back a touch on the nose.","Palate: Light, with mild warmth. Very smoky and phenolic, but tastes better than it smells at this point. The fruit notes are almost completely gone here, dominated by the taste of a hospital floor… but in a good way… right…?  ","Finish: Phenol and a nice, balanced warmth persist on the finish. The medicinal profile fades out a bit quicker than the rest of the notes, allowing this to rebound on the finish a little.","Score: C+ (C = ok, B = nice to have, A = must have)","Notes: I think I prefer my older bottling of 10yr better than this, and Lore definitely falls short of hitting the high marks of the 18yr or Portwood. Very sad to see this from Laphroaig; it’s quite possible this is due to my palate more than the dram itself, but I can safely say I won’t be seeking out a bottle.","Status: Ask /u/toadpooh, but I’m sure it’s a relatively newly opened bottle.",Color: Walnut – about on par with Laga 16 and Oogie,"Nose: Smoke, dried fruit, peat and seafoam in the background. More earthy and campfire-y instead of being medicinal and chemical-y like the Lore.","Palate: Light at first, but warms up VERY quickly, but still kind of light-bodied. Sweet smoke and dried fruit are here as well, but try as I may I can’t get much more out of this one.",Finish: Warm and smoky all the way through. Very nice way to wrap up an Islay dram.,"Score: B+ ish (C = ok, B = nice to have, A = must have)","Notes: Most enjoyable so far, though I don’t know if I’d say the most interesting. That honor would still probably go to the Laga 8. The proof is a very nice feature here, keeping the finish long and pleasant, without getting in the way, and the fruit notes are nice as well. This and the Laga 8 are my winners of the evening.","Status: Bottle purchased early 2015, opened for about a year.",Color: Walnut – about on par with Laga 16 and Dark Cove,"Nose: Very mild peat, smoked meats, a touch of brine. Doesn’t open up much past that (it’s been ‘opening’ for a year), but I’d say a little more of the meaty note comes through.","Palate: Medium body and medium warmth that builds up nicely. Smoky and meaty through and through. Really makes me think of a pork brisket, if such a thing existed – in the sense that the smoke dominates the meat (Speaking of which, I need to go get me some burnt ends…). ","Finish: Kinda quick for the proof (thanks Oxygen…), but nice and smoky all the way through. I really remember this having more of a fruit note when I first opened the bottle, sad to say it’s faded over the last year.","Score: B (C = ok, B = nice to have, A = must have)","Notes: It’s fine, but not nearly as complex as I remember it being in the past. Could be air, could be my palate, could be both. ","Notes: I’d call this a tie between Oog and Laga 8yr for second, with Dark Cove CR taking a slight edge over the two. I can’t complain about drinking any of these (except Lore), so the margin of victory was pretty small and I question my ability to pick out the two Ardbegs blind. I’m pretty sure I could discern the Lagas and Laprhaoig, however.","Nose: plain ol’ peat. Kinda mild, without much going on. Laphroaigy. Palate: sweet, smoky, slightly meaty. Also Laphroaigy. Finish: I’m sure you can guess. Dammit Lore! Opens up a bit, actually, with more of that Ardbeg character coming through, but still not as enjoyable. I used it to ‘braise’ a piece of steak, stay tuned for tasting notes on that experiment!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4qzr9n/scotchit_reviews_8791_laga_8_vs_laga_16_vs_lore/

Leather, tobacco and the ocean (although it may be the ocean I am next to).  ","Palate:  Sweet, sweet sherry wood smoked barbeque.  This is strong as hell but the smokiness overpowers the sherry rather easily.  The sherry is more of a hint rather than a blast like the Uigeadail.","Finish:  Despite my former smoker’s palate, I cannot quite handle this dram.  It leaves me completely numb at first but soon the smoke slowly rushes back in and envelops the mouth.  There is not much sherry left here but it definitely leads to a sweet tangy barbeque lingering.","Overall:  In a word, awesome Ardbeginess.  According to Mark Harvey, Business Development Director for Glenmorangie and the person running the event, Ardbeg Day Committee release is a mix between 7, 8 and 12 year old Ardbeg that is finished for 6 months in ex-sherry casks.  Because of this limited finish time it resembles to me the middle point between the fiery power of the 10 year old and the sherry sweetness of the Uigeadail.  Ardbeg Day is very enjoyable for those of us who enjoy our smokey Islays young and powerful with some depth and complexity to them.

Ardbeg Galileo,"Nose: Definitely sweet for an Ardbeg. Sure, there's all that peaty Ardbegness you expect, but the Marsala sweetness is balancing rather well at this point. I'd almost say that this whisky leans further towards the sweet than the savoury at this point. Lovely vanilla bean, coconut, green apples and a sweet herbal note (mint with a pinch of oregano), mixed with just enough of that classic earthy peat we all expect from Ardbeg.","Palate: Perfect strength for a full-bodied flavour, yet totally drinkable and without burn neat. The Marsala casks are really stealing the show here, evoking sweet flavours of plums, white grapes, and a hint of green tea. Bill Lumsden (head distiller at Ardbeg and Glenmorangie) reckons that he needed to use a fair bit of the standard bourbon-aged Ardbeg to balance out the wine casks, but I can't imagine how intense the Marsala-aged whisky would be on its own, since it seems to be playing a huge role here already. ","Finish: Medium-short finish. Quite salty, a little more savoury but still not close to the savoury character of the Alligator or Ten Year. It's as if the savoury aspect is adding to the wine cask sweetness and creating a bigger flavour, rather than just evening out the balance by masking some of the sweetness. A little dry oak coming through at the end in what may be the first and only foreground appearance by the bourbon-matured whisky.",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1720nv/review_ardbeg_galileo/c81g88d

The peat really takes center stage as the sweetness fades.","Overall: This is like the regular 10 year old expression on steroids. This is everything I expected with a young, CS Laphroaig.

This is a peat/sulphur attack on your senses. While I prefer the sweeter side of scotch, this is what I would consider a definitive Islay flavor profile. It is a peat barrage with bits of sulphur (in a good way) and feinty flavors and, while this isn’t exactly my cup of tea, I can appreciate the complexity and youthfulness of this beast.",Color: Amber,"Nose: Peat, caramel, honey, campfire, brine, big oak, buttercream and ripe red fruits.","Taste: Light mouthfeel, light-medium body. Surprisingly sweet for a 12 year old Ardbeg. Mossy peat, sea salt, brine, wood oil, vanilla, honey, sweet citrus, more buttercream and white pepper.","Finish: Somewhat underwhelming. More peat, with oak and sweet citrus; yet the flavors seem muted.  This finish isn’t what I’ve come to expect from Ardbeg. Very earthy and sweet with bits of floral notes in the background. Ripe red fruits as well. However muted the flavors may be, the finish does have a very nice length, however. It remains long after your last sip.","Overall: For the price of this bottle, I’d take a glass of Oogie any day. This is a delicious dram, don’t get me wrong, but I guess I had over-hyped it in my expectations.

The nose was ever-evolving and it was very well balanced, albeit sweet. But I like sweet, I am a bourbon expat, after all. I liked this as a step away from traditional Ardbegs. I felt like it was very well done and something very different for them. The one disappointment - if you want to call it that - I had was the short finish.

Ardbeg Supernova 2009,"Context: I was once again dramming in the dimly-lit rockin' environment of Chicago's Delilah's. I didn't get color notes this time (sorry) and I have no prices either, but I can tell you both 1oz pours were a wee bit costly. My opinion of this distillery keeps on rising, so let's dive in!  ","Intro: Ardbeg Alligator is matured in ""severely charred"" American oak barrels. (The name comes from the resemblance of the charred wood to gator skin.) New or first fill ex-bourbon barrels? I'm not certain, so please chime in! 51.2%.  ","Nose: Pine tar, ink, and melted nylon.  ","Dram: Oily. Fresh asphalt, black licorice, and light malt.  ","Finish: Peat, char, coal, salt, pine, Chloroseptic, and more tar.  ","Conclusions: Tart, puckering, and mouth-numbing. Dare I nickname this Ardbeg Double Black? No, I won't. A bit too medicinal and bit like licking your scotch off a hot road. But quite a powerful experience. 83/100  ","Intro: Ardbeg Supernova is peated to 100PPM, which makes it (by that measure) the peatiest scotch I've tried. Also, it is cask strength at 58.9%.  ",Nose: Peat! Very powerful. Burning butcher's shop and smoldering leather furniture.  ,"Dram: I might as well type ""peat"" again. Fresh tobacco, unagi, seaweed, salt, and zest.  ","Finish: Would you believe it if I said ""peat?"" Ash, lemon, lime, wharf water, wormwood, and vodka.  ","Conclusions: Tough to score. A little too much peat and a little too little malt. Some off-notes in an otherwise wonderfully powerful dram. If there's no such thing as too much peat for your taste, then you have a friend in Supernova. 85/100  ","Comparyvreckans: I've now sampled more offerings from Ardbeg than any other distillery, and there's still more to try.

Ardbeg Supernova 2009,Nose: Meaty smoke. Peat. Apples and pears. Salt air. Salted caramel. Spicy solvent. ,Palate: BIG smoke. Thick syrup sweetness. Brine. Smoked peaches. Sour apples.

Ardbeg Supernova 2009,Color: Pale Gold.,"Nose: Biggest peat explosion I have ever nosed. Also very peppery. A bit of eucalyptus like in the Ardbeg 10 and a good deal of brine. Burnt Pinetrees or pinecones, but in a good way. Like being on a winter holiday and making a campfire after skiing or boarding all day while it's cold out and you are telling stories by the fire. ","Mouthfeel: Oily, thick.","Taste: Peat. Smoke. Salt. That is all I get on the initial sip. It's really intense, like a Supernova should be I guess. But it turns out to be very rich. With elements of crushed pepper, Cuban cigars, roasted hazelnuts, ristretto, citrus flavours and burnt pinecones. ",Finish: Endless and very very powerful. The Cuban cigar keeps lingering as well as the pepper.,"Overall: This dram really takes you to a snowy mountain top on a starry night in front of a fire fueled by pinewood. And you are not cold, because this powerful stuff keeps you warm. It's safe to say that this is my favourite dram so far.

After a few sips when the initial impacts wears off I get some licorice, lemon/lime, 100% cacao chocolate, but that all very much takes a back seat to the smoke.

I’m surprised that this is flaunted as such a big peat explosion (even if it technically is), because there’s so much more happening here than any one-note peat smoke stuff.","Finish: Suddenly, a meaty barbeque smokiness that seemed previously obscured bursts out.

","Finish: The peatsmoke goes on and on, becoming more briny. At the end, a lovely smoky sweetness remains.","Thoughts: I think I'm not being too daring to say this is a cask-strength Islay, bourbon matured. I would say mid 50's on the ABV.

Ardbeg Supernova 2010,Age: NAS -,Colour: Pale Straw/Light Gold,"Nose: The pleasant wave of nice Fat Earthy, Dusty, Grassy Peat smells familiar and reminds me of the 10 Years. The ABV of the Supernova is much higher of course and the Alcohol is noticeable. But once your Nose gets accustomed to the Peat a whole array of other Aromas present themselves in Waves. Take your time with this Single Malt because there is much more to it than the first impression would want you to believe. First of all there's lots of Black Pepper and Chili. But I also get Tar, Cigar Ashes, Rubber/PVC, Leather, Smoke, Wood Polish, Tobacco, Honey, Olive Oil, Buttered Toast and Salt. There's some young Oak as well and, in general, the Supernova has a young and savage feel to it like the 10 years. Much stronger though on account of the high ABV. Not too much Fruity tones here and when, than more dried than fresh. Some Green Apple perhaps and Citrus Peel. Finally some hints of Aniseed and Espresso.   ","Palate: Very strong delivery. The Peat is much stronger here than on the Nose. Very Hot & Spicy as well with Chili and Black Pepper. But in general the Palate follows the Nose with Cigar (Smoke and Ashes), Leather, Mint, Charred Wood, Aniseed Grass/Straw, PVC, light Licorice, Citrus, Tobacco, Salt and Burnt Sugar.","Finish: Very Long, Sweet and Spicy at first but Dry towards the end. Lots of Black Pepper and Chili start the show followed by Sweet lingering Peat, Vanilla, Orange, Tar, Ashes, Leather, Dark Chocolate, Charred Oak, light Licorice, Aniseed and Espresso.",Rating: 88.5,Nose: 22.5 - Taste: 22 - Finish: 22 - Overall: 22,"Remarks: The Ardbeg (Little Height in Gaelic) Distillery is located on the South Coast of the Isle of Islay. The Distillery was founded in 1794 and commercial production started in 1815. It was closed between 1981 and 1989 after which it produced on a low scale until 1997 when it was bought by Glenmorangie Plc, part of the French LVMH Group. The Supernova was first released in 2009 but today we taste the 2010 Release that has a slightly higher ABV. The Peat Level is slightly over 100 ppm (phenols per million) compared to  slightly over 50 ppm for the Ardbeg 10 and Laphroaig 10. We can therefore expect heavy Smoke and Peat! Prices started at around 130 US Dollars but quickly increased to up to 270 US Dollars.",Neat: Very Good. ,"Conclusion: In the end I rated the Supernova 2010 just a tad higher than the 10 Years. The reason is quite easy. I like them both a lot. And yet, they are certainly different whiskies although the first impressions on the Nose are very similar. They both represent Islay in their own way however. To me, the 10 is the Sea with the Brine, the Salted Fish and the general Harbour feeling. The Supernova is less coastal and represents the Earthy Mud of the Peat Bogs seasoned by the Salty Rain. The Supernova is stronger but indeed very peated on the Palate. There, the 10 is bit more balanced in my opinion. Still, both are very good Islays. Not your every day drams perhaps but nearly unbeatable on one of those Cold, Rainy, Stormy Nights in front of the fireplace. Not that we have a lot of those in Sao Paulo of course.

Plenty of spice most prominently pepper and chilli. Fresh bitumen/tar, like driving down a road that was resealed a week ago. A bit deeper I get the peat which was surprising as I was expecting a big hit. Then upon making the accident of giving a big sniff into my glenciarn the peat destroyed my poor nose. Only the patient will get the most out of this as you can keep searching and looking into the depths.

A little bit of citrus, oak and vegetation in the background. 24/25",Finish: The peat has decided to stay for good. It’s setting up camp inside my mouth forever. And...I’m ok with that. 4 -5 minutes later it’s still here just a little subdued. All the flavours I just tasted swirling and dancing around coming alive and then disappearing only to come back somewhere else....... 23/25,"Overall: I first opened this while having some friends over for a get together and didn't really appreciate it too much and was almost a little concerned that I had make a mistake on this. But after sitting down with this for an hour I know I made the right choice. The most amazing nose I've had on a whisky to date. Richness, subtly, complexity and simplicity all at the same time. With the nose I'm imagining that I'm drinking from a glass of flavoured swirling smoke that never blends into one single flavour. The taste while not amazingly complex is brilliant. It knows what it wants to be and it does it perfectly and it just lingers so amazingly. Usually after swallowing I get a different set of flavours and strengths but this just keeps on going without any interruption. 25/25",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1bzcml/ardbeg_supernova_2010_review_6/

I feel the supernova was a bit too delicate on the other flavours to really balance out the peat; a problem which the Corryvreckan and Uigeadail do not share.

Ardbeg Supernova 2014,"Nose: I didn't even have to get close to the glass to smell the peat wafting from the glass.  Oily peat that is driven by an oily, fishy aroma.  Plenty of smoked salmon.  Lemon zest and citrus oil.  Like collecting pine needles in a forest, then burning them in a camp fire.  Some smoked kippers as well.  There is great layering in the nose for such a heavily peated whisky.  The peat smoke seems to rest on top, closest to your senses.  The fishy notes reside on the next layer, and the citrusy notes on the last.  Well balanced and more complex than I expected.",Taste: The peat calms the hell down in the arrival.  It holds a good dose of sea salt.  This sets the stage for the lighter lemon oil and citrus notes.  Refreshingly sweet on the palate as it develops.  It melds into a chocolaty-golden raisin combo.  Some mild vanilla and caramel.,"Finish: This marks the return of the oily, sooty peat and smoked salmon.  The finish is dry and slightly peppery.  A pleasant nip of alcohol tickles your mouth and lips.  Sweet and salty.","Nose: It's as if you are standing next to a raging camp fire that has just been drenched with buckets of water.  The smoke seems to fill every crack and crevice  of your senses.  What's somewhat unexpected, is that within that smoldering fog of smoke is an inherent salty-sweetness.  Sea salt and brine, typical for me in Bruichladdich, and a thick barley note.  Rubber erasers scorched from rubbing them vigorously for too long.  Some mild apple cider vinegar strangely enough.  Slightly nutty, but oily and thick.  The peat doesn't relent.","Taste: This is a beast of a whisky when tasted neat.  The tendrils of peat smoke wrap around you in the arrival, pulling you in until the alcohol abruptly smacks you in the face.  Once you come to your senses, you can detect that nice barley note again.  More salt and salted caramel and butterscotch.  The peat doesn't relent.","Finish: The finish is miles long, consisting primarily of peat of course.  The peat is still very much in the drivers seat.  The casks have joined the experience in the finish.  There is some toasted oak and butter toffee.

Ardbeg Twenty Something,Color: Gold.,"Nose: The typical slightly sweet Ardbeg nose fills the room as I type this. I sense burned licorice, some dry fir forest and a (very) little amount of smoked, spicy meat. Every time I take another nose, I find new shades, even some which may be related to the sherry casks: Dark chocolate, gooseberries, even oranges. The nose becomes lighter over the time, dropping most of its fire. I, personally, like that very much.","Taste: Surprise: Starting sweet while burning on the tongue, the taste quickly splits into various fruit (peaches, plums, raspberries, some figs and raisins) and woodsmoke and (again) licorice flavors, it's like drinking an extract of Scandinavia's various forests mixed with a fruit cocktail while the mouth is largely watered. On second sip, the burning becomes less dense and so do the fruit, making more room to let the sherry finally become obvious by leaving a silky touch and providing some vanilla milk chocolate as a lovely contrast.","Finish: A sugared campfire slowly burns out, taking its well-earned time. This dram gradually dries towards the end, leaving milk chocolate and conifers on my tongue and palate.","Verdict: 95.5/100 on my peat scale, 86/100 on my everything-else-scale, the latter (as usual) including a large complexity bonus, but also a huge penalty for the price; about 500 € as I'm writing this.

It made the experience much better since I'm pretty sure we lost that one, in fact I remember the finish of the whisky more than the game. It's like when you go to a bonfire and the next day your clothes smell the smoke from the fire. Since this is one of my favorite smells, this is a real winner. I definitely will be exploring more peated whiskys in the future. ","Conclusion: This may not be saying much but this has been the best dram I have had so far.

Ardbeg Uigeadail,Color: Very pale. Chardonnay.,"Nose: Sweet peat. Sea spray, bacon fat, cereal malt. Lightly sweet, heavily peated. Fresh mint.","Taste: Warm, heavy medicinal peat. Medium body. Campfire smoke, bacon fat, sea air. Floral notes, linens, a touch of sweet granny smith apples. Very malty with a bit of sweet cereal and starch(reminds me of eating plain noodles).","Finish: Briny, very medicinal. A bit of firewood/wood oil.  Still very malty with a touch of pepper. There is a lingering bit of wood oil that stays in the background throughout.","Overall: A very young, but tasty dram. This packs a big peat punch in a very mellow tone. I have only had this offering from Ardbeg, so we’ll see how tasty the other two drams will be. This is always my go to when I’ve grilled or smoked something on my grill.",Price: $40,Total: 83/100,Color: Deep amber,"Nose: Peat bomb! Very medicinal, but with a heavy sherry influence as well. Wow the cask strength really shines through. No alcohol burn, but very big flavors. Molasses, iodine, sweet sherry, saltwater toffee, toasted oak and almonds. So big, yet nuanced as well.","Taste: Warm right off the bat! Very delicious and spiced. Charred oak, vanilla, huge peat, iodine, sweet sherry, tobacco. Maple syrup, wood oil and citrus. Heavily spiced, white pepper, and subtle malt.",Finish: So long. The spice notes linger in equal parts with the peat smoke and iodine. Very woody with sherry making for a nice counter balance.,"Overall: Wow. The difference between this and the 10 is staggering. The subtleties of this dram absolutely blow the 10 out of the water.  I feel like I would write a ten page review on this dram as it mellows and develops over its time in the glass. This is well worth the price difference for how much of an improvement it is over the 10 year. I added a touch of water, but I would say this dram needs none. I wanted to see how the dram develops with a bit of water and I think the experience suffers with the addition.",Total: 95/100,Color: Gold,"Nose: Another peat bomb. More malty than the Uigeadail, not as malty as the 10. Sweet buttercream, fresh apples, wood oil, vanilla, campfire, peat smoke and iodine.","Taste: Very oily mouthfeel. Heavily peated malt, earthy, sweet buttercream, wood oil, campfire smoke, and bacon fat. White pepper, honey, and charred oak. Light hints of green grapes and sweet/dry white wine. Once again, less sweet than Uig, but still a great balance.","Finish: Spicy, no burn, heavy oak influence with medicinal peat. Hints of fresh linens, fresh green grapes, and figs linger lightly in the background.","Overall: This is a fantastic dram. I liked the Uigeadail better, but this dram is still fantastic. It packs a great punch, big flavors, subtle nuances, everything in balance. Nothing negative to say about this malt.

The nose is my favourite part.  I don’t think the taste and the finish quite match up to the nose or the hype and this is about in line with the more recent reviews (as opposed to older bottlings).

Not too short, or too long.","Conclusion: I know this is cliché, but my words really can’t describe how much I love this. This whisky makes me salivate when I smell it. Granted, I’m from Kansas City and therefore have a deep love of BBQ (stereotypical, I know) and I also happen to have a love of Islays, so this is along the lines of my ideological whisky. This whisky is not subtle and it will abuse your senses, but that’s not a bad thing sometimes. I know there’s some fatigue on this sub with Ardbeg because their marketing is eye-roll worthy and they are rolling out a new NAS whisky what seems to be every-other month, but that doesn’t matter to me if the whisky itself is high quality and enjoyable. I think this whisky is a great value at any price under $70, and in the $71-$85 range it’s probably still priced fairly. This bottle will be replaced quickly on my shelf after being consumed.

Ardbeg Uigeadail,Review: Ardbeg Uigeadail - Review #13,Price: $64.99 Julio's,"Scene: This was so highly rated I just had to have a bottle.  Definitely out of my whisky sweet spot, but I am hoping the sherry cask finish gives this a dimension that Ardbeg 10 is missing.  This is the third NCF bottle I am rating after many non-NCFs to start my single malt journey.  Letting this sit for a good long while due to the cask strength.","Appearance: Gasoline! Slightly thicker legs than expected that seem to bead up for a long time then run quickly down the glass.  Not really as expected - I though thinner legs = higher ABV, and speed of drip matches ""stuff"" in the liquid - so a NCF should drip slower due to more stuff in the whisky (oils, etc).",http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1izzh8/ardbeg_uigeadail_review_13/

Sherry really comes through on the nose. Palate changes dramatically. Butter and caramel appear. (I'm not doing a with water write up, now. Maybe when I buy a bottle.)

Some sweet malt comes through after a few minutes, but no peat shows up that I can find. Perhaps this is due to how long the bottle has been opened, as I recall Laga 16 having more character in the past, but the nose is not very characteristic of a sherried Islay like I’d expect.

Ardbeg Uigeadail,"Colour: A dark murky amber. Hints of something brighter, though, but that could've just been the lighting.","Nose: The wood hit me first - a sort of burnt wood. Then a leather-type smell began to sink in. I was also smelling preserved olives, brine (or sea salt), and old paper - similar to that in an older library. There wasn't really any alcohol burn that I could smell.","Mouth: Upon first entry, I was definitely tasting the salt, leather, burnt wood combination. Not bad, and definitely a good taste. The olives came through later. I also started tasting bitter herbs and semi-hot spices within the flavours, and finally, a hint of Chinese herbal medicines hit me. There wasn't any great separation of the flavours, unlike the Nadurra or the A'bunadh. You could detect all of them, but they were packaged together, versus one after another.","Finish: It stuck around, like olive oil tends to stick around for me. The spices lingered the longest, but I could still feel the leather and the old paper long afterwards. It kind of made me feel nostalgic, imagining an old English private library that I've never actually been to.","Conclusion: Damn good stuff. I usually avoid peaty scotches like the plague, possibly because of a bad early experience. I'm glad I decided to revisit them with this one, because it was so unobnoxious, but different. Everything I liked about scotch was still there, and new flavours and aromas were experienced.

Ardbeg Uigeadail,"Color: Amber, noticeably darker compared to the 10 which I remember as being very pale. Sherry influence is evident. ","Nose: Moderate smoke, leather, glue, raisins and figs, molasses, wet moss","Palate: Blend of sweet and tart, a little briny, and smoky. Not the savory, meaty kind of flavors I get with something like an Octomore, but more malty and fruity with a touch of salt. Raisins with a hint of lemon peel. The peat influence is lighter than I expected, nowhere near as intense as the 10 or Laphroaig QC, for example. ","Finish: Much like the palate: smoky sweetness with a touch of brine, leather, and walnuts. Pleasant dryness. The peat doesn't overpower.                                                                                          ","Conclusion: Got about halfway through this bottle and figured it’s about time to review it. This is of course a classic around here, and for good reason. I dig this kind of combination of peat and sherry, or peat and sweet generally, and this is hard to beat for availability and value. I wouldn’t describe it as a peat bomb for those who are into that, but I prefer this gentler type. Not a punch in the throat like the 10, with more complexity.

Muted/soft dark fruits (Sherry influence). (18/25),Finish: Medium. The soft peat and muted dark fruits just kind of fall away leaving a spicy oiliness on the tongue. (16/25),Impression: This is certainly a disappointing release from Ardbeg. I would imagine that it's the equivalent of Laphroaig Select. It is certainly a soft experience and while it contains the classic Ardbeg ashy peat and mouthfeel it fails to do anything other than remind me how much better the 10 y/o is.

Ardbeg Uigeadail,"Nose: Interesting. Behind the ethanol, which is noticeable, is a hodgepodge of smoke, pie crust, wet earth, and something like roasting meat.  It's like somebody made a bacon pie and set it on fire.  It's a different peat profile than I've experienced. Very BBQ, smoked meat.  ",Finish:  Quite warming and long.

But the high proof and fairly massive peat levels overpower the rest.   One of my challenges as a newcomer to peated Scotch, has been finding the vanilla or other flavors behind that wall of peat. I managed some here, and the peat isn't medicinal like I get with the Frog.  So that's mostly positive. For now, I'll give it a B at 86/100.

Ardbeg Uigeadail,Distillery: Ardbeg,Age: NAS,Source: 750mL bottle $68 USD,"Summary: This thing is crazy weird. Not just the weird unpronounceable name, but everything else too. With a name like ""uoooouuouogadagagadalaladal"", I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. All the flavors are very distinct and somewhat disjoint. It tastes like someone couldn't decide if they like sherry or peat, and went ""WHY NOT BOTH?"" For extra good measure, throw in some Bourbon too. Now you take a handful of all these wonderful things, and just shove them all in your mouth at the same time. The change it gets with water and time is unbelievable too, and then it settles into its final form. Overall it's very weird, but the good kind of weird. It is complex, it is unapologetic, it is diverse. Glad I have a bottle, and it's probably not going to last very long at this rate. I'm giving it 1 bonus point for the value factor here with the high strength, the non-chill-filtration, and the natural color at the price I paid.

The impression I get overall is a touch warmer and well rounded than the other two.

Ardbeg Uigeadall,"Color: Fairly Light golden color. Thought it would have more pinkish Sherry influence hues. [evidently, because Steve Perry’s girlfriend, and others, are named “Sherry”, my iPad will forever capitalize it. I am done correcting this]. ","Nose: Barely any ethanol. I’m hesitant to say, peat, as it’s there but isn’t obviously smoke, or earthy vegetation, or BBQ meat or band-aids. Or rather it’s all of those. There is a smell I’d call “tarry ozone”, like water evaporating off of fresh hot pavement after a rain. There is a light fruity and perhaps floral aspect, not like roses but wild flowering trees or shrubs. ","Finish: Fairly long, minimal burn. Gentle smoke, some residual sweetness like honey graham crackers. Very pleasant all the way. The peat smoke lasts a good long time. ","Conclusion: Well, as expected, I like it better.  Not as much as some things I’ve had, but it’s quite good. I think I would trade some peat for more Sherry influence. For example, I like my Talisker DE better than this at an identical price point. I find the palate pleasant, but pretty simple really. The nose is more interesting and the finish is nice. Score it a low B+ at 87/100. I might be cheating it a point.

Ardmore 15 Gordon & MacPhail 1991,Color: pale gold,"Nose: Some pears and sour lemon, then some ash. The peat is quite subdued, but there's quite a bit of heat coming from the nose. After a while, it gets a bit sweeter with banana notes.","Palate: Drying oak, tar and ash, then some pepper. A very simple palate, too bad some of the fruity notes from the nose don't come through","Finish: The ash continues for a while, some very feint hints of honey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3g1xi7/ardmore_19912006_gordon_macphail/

Ardmore 16 1998 Gordon & MacPhail Binny's Selection,"Nose: Fruity sherry with a bit of a sulphur note - bananas, caramelized apples, glazed donuts, and some gunflint.",Palate: Sherry takes a spicy turn with red pepper flakes and nutmeg - oak presents quite dry with tart apples dusted with cinnamon.,Finish: Turns heavily herbal as sherry fades rapidly. Spicy peppers remain on tip of tongue as musty oak takes hold in the rear palate.,Rating: 87/100 - One of the spicier sherried expressions I've tried which results in a nice contrasting profile.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/4oywip/review_193_ardmore_16_gordon_macphail_19982015/
Ardmore 16 Cadenhead's,"Nose: The first thing I noticed was a very mild sulphurous note, but I didn't notice this again so I may have imagined it.

",Finish: Medium length finish starting out with stewed fruits and cinnamon following up.  ,"Nose: Much peatier than the ppm of phenols would suggest, we were told it was only peated to around 16 ppm. Smoked pork, salt, pepper, and fresh road tar.  ","Palate: Smoke and peat come forward at first, followed by a citric lemon note, smoky bacon, old ground pepper, salted toffee.  ","Finish: Lingering smoke, slightly salty, lemon, and a slightly vegetal note.  ","Nose: Peat and smoke, coastal, and oily.  ","Palate: Smoke, vegetal, oils, sweet caramel, full bodied, and an Earthy flavour.  ","Finish: Lingering smoke, funghi, caramel.

Ardmore 16 SMWS 66.62,Price: approx. $165   ,"Nose: Raspberry, strawberry, figs, dates, caramel, cured and smoked meat, hint of peat. So well balanced with sweet and savory.   ","Taste: Juicy red fruit, raisin, clams/mussels, toffee, capicola, smoke, farm-y peat, green pepper, clove and/or nutmeg. There is a lot going on here and it can be tough to distinguish exactly what you’re tasting, but it’s beautiful when combined. As expected, this has a superb mouthfeel.     ","Finish: Mint, pepper, ash, capicola, sweet berries, smoked salmon, and wayyyyy down in the throat there is a charred tomato/pepper-like taste. It’s the weirdest, most unique note I’ve experienced, but it’s really extraordinary. ","Conclusion: My goodness. This whisky obliterates the unique scale. A lot of wild notes with a weird finish, but it made me want to keep going back. A superb whisky.    ",Overall: A,Note: Scores are based on the quality of the whisky.
